Dominique N.,"New York, NY",12/20/2022,5 star rating,"Jean-Georges' casual yet chic restaurant features amazing Mediterranean dishes, balanced cocktails, and impressive ambiance. The crab toast and brick oven pizza are amazing. And there is even a tree in the dining room for extra special flare!"
Bob U.,"Dublin, CA",12/2/2022,4 star rating,"beautiful decor (not shocked) and ambiance. fantastic service and wonderful food. we were a large group, which I know is annoying for the waitstaff, but they were amazing. especially in a large group, I encourage sharing of some of the whole wheat crust pizzas. we sampled the brussels sprouts (might sound odd, but was great), spinach with goat cheese and regular tomato and mozzarella. for the main I had sea bass which was delicious, although I would have preferred a bit more veggies and starch in the dish (yes I know there are some served as sides). we also ordered a bunch of desserts but the cookie plate was the favorite by far. at the table, everyone enjoyed the duck and cheeseburgerI didn't realize this was a Jean-Georges joint, but it certainly lived up to his reputation. highly recommended!"
Ketki P.,"Boston, MA",11/29/2022,4 star rating,"Came here for lunch recently. The vibe of this place is warm and comfortable. But the service could have been better. After seating at the table, no one showed up for 10-12 minutes. Our server was great. He gave good recommendations about the salad. I ordered lavender peach kombucha which was amazing. We then ordered chicory and fig salad which was served with manchego cheese. It was delicious. Highly recommend to try it. I also ordered Brussels sprouts spicy pine nut pizza. It was unique and extremely tasty. If the service would have been better I would have given 5 stars. All in all it is good place which serves great food prepared from local ingredients."
Anna Q.,"Walnut, CA",11/26/2022,1 star rating,"Terrible service, okay food. I wasn't seated until 40 minutes past my reservation time. That was already really upsetting and the food took too long to arrive. Portions were quite small and the only redeeming dishes were the pizzas, which were good but not wait-40-minutes-past-your-res-time-looking-awkward-by-the-bar good. Friend got the MP lobster, which was a really sad dish of just a poorly overcooked lobster chopped in half. I had really high expectations for this restaurant but it really, really sucked. The ambiance was beautiful and the decor was tasteful too, it just wasn't worth the time that we waited, and we weren't even full after the meal. I want to give this place the benefit of the doubt and say that we ordered the wrong dishes, but they were just too mediocre. Will not be coming back."
Gab G.,"New York, NY",11/23/2022,4 star rating,"Returned like six years later for dinner and had a great meal. Feels super pricey now, but it definitely holds up. I tried:+ Mission fig colada + Pineapple milk punch - both drinks were great+ Peekytoe crab toast - highlight #1+ Yellowfin tuna crudo - letdown, super peppery + Kale salad - little too vinegary + Chestnut gigli pasta - great + Steamed Black Sea bass - highlight #2+ Market plum and pear crisp - highlight #3+ Chocolate layer cake Overall ABC is still a fantastic choice, just be prepared to spend big time."
Sandy C.,"Vancouver, Canada",12/6/2022,5 star rating,Everything we ordered was really good. The mushrooms pizza and the duck main dish especially stood out.
Neghena H.,"Arlington, VA",12/13/2022,5 star rating,"The ambience is great, I also love how all the abc restaurants are within one building but they all have different vibes and theme. Between my friend and I we shared the ravioli, broccolini and the basil, tomato pizza. 10/10 recommend. Also dessert is a must here."
Kim X.,"New York, NY",9/18/2022,3 star rating,"This was definitely a 3.5. We got a reservation for three on a Saturday night. By the time we decided to eat here, they only had reservations at the cocktail table. It was a nice unevenly shaped tall table with three high chairs with no back support. This was fine with me but I was shocked that there were no hooks or at least a place to put/hang bags and jackets.The cocktails were ok for the price of 17-19 dollars. We shared the heirloom tomato toast which was delicious. Our waitress really didn't know the menu well bc she said it would be cut perfectly into three pieces but it came out in four. I got the honey roasted duck. It was good except there was too much of the strong white sauce which overpowered the rest of the meal. The cheeseburger and fries were good. What was disappointing was the fried chicken! My friend does not like Swiss chard. The waitress reassured her that there was barely any Swiss chard in the dish and that it was only used in the sauce. I was skeptical as the menu literally says fried chicken and Swiss chard.... The waitress was soooo wrong. If my friend had known, she would've gotten another dish or asked for the Swiss chard to be replaced. Also, the Swiss chard had a very strong rose flavored taste which was overwhelmingly bad. It was like eating perfume.It would've been a four if not for the really disappointing fried chicken dish."
Ana M.,"Brooklyn, NY",6/12/2022,3 star rating,"What a fancy restaurant! I loved the restaurant's decor style of white oak, wooden accents, and antique pieces with branches and ambient lighting. On a normal day, I wouldn't approach ABC Kitchen due to it being on the higher end of pricing - but fortunately for me, I was able to try this place out with my colleagues! The restaurant was pretty spacious and was able to accomdoate our party of 9. The waitstaff were very accomodating and checked up on us plenty of times to make sure we were okay. Our food took around ~1.5 hours to arrive, which was longer than we would've liked. I ordered a coconut water, pizza w/ basil, mozzarella, and tomato sauce, and fries. The dough of my pizza was burnt, and the sauce/cheese did not hold on well to the dough because it kept slipping off whenever I grabbed a slice. For the price, I would hope the structural integrity would be better. The fries were a delight and great appetizer to share with everyone. All in all, it was a nice place to dine at. Food was okay, but don't come if you only have an hour for lunch!"
Meng Z.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",6/3/2022,4 star rating,"Great ambiance with delicious and unique dishes! I came up with a group of friends for dinner and the ambiance was great for a friends catch up. I got the crab toast and Black Truffle, Fontina, and Farm Egg Pizza to share with my boyfriend.  Both dishes were absolutely delicious and unique. The crab toast was really fresh and the squeeze of lemon juice on top really adds to it. I love the truffle and the egg mix on the pizza. It was honestly a great combo and a tasty pizza. Can't wait to come back and try the other unique dishes they have!"
Tanya I.,"New York, NY",5/12/2022,5 star rating,"Every time you visit ABC Kitchen, you can be sure that you will have a great experience. The restaurant features a changing menu, to feature seasonal vegetable dishes, while also maintaining favorites.We kicked off the night with the Roasted Carrot and Avocado salad... 1 word: Amazing! I am not necessarily the biggest fan of carrots, but this dish is sweet and savory and everything you could want in a salad.Next is the Fluke Tartare. I did not expect much from this dish as ABC Kitchen is usually more focused on locally sourced veggies, but it was definitely tasty. Also the chips - they are so light and crispy I don't even know.We also ordered the calamari. This is very different than fried calamari I've gotten at other places. ABC Kitchen's chef fries them to perfection with a sweet/salty crust. Hence... the pretzel taste.Our last starter was the Black Truffle Stracciatella. This was liquid gold. I have nothing else to say.Any pizza you get is honestly delicious. I don't have anything bad to say about them. The crust: yum! The toppings: yum!The Habanero Fried Chicken is a refreshing and elevated take on fried chicken. The crispiness is light and fluffy, and the spice is at just the right level. ABC Kitchen outdoes itself with that one. I order this dish with a side of mashed potatoes and it is honestly one of the best I have ever had.The duck is seasonal, and so popular that it is sometimes sold out when we go!! Absolutely delicious. I don't usually love duck but this was so good.The Ricotta Ravioli... I am not usually a fan of ravioli, funnily enough, but this dish is so tasty. I know this review may seem like an ode to ABC Kitchen, but honestly, everything I have tried here was a 10/10.For desserts... The chocolate cake is absolutely amazing. I don't know what type of chocolate crunch they put on there but it made the whole cake so much better. And the toasted marshmallows?? I mean... yum!Finally... You CANNOT skip this Caramel Sundae. It has everything you could love. Hot chocolate fudge, crispy caramel popcorn and delicious ice cream. What more can I say?"
Tina W.,"New York, NY",2/26/2022,4 star rating,Had a great dining a while ago. Just need to catch up with all my reviews. Food is delicious and it's better to take your date here rather dining aloneI had their salad and beef tartar. Both are great.
Ria G.,"New York, NY",3/18/2022,4 star rating,"What a gem! Beautiful interior and a great spot for a date or catching up with some friends. The interior is very spacious and wonderfully decorated. Ordered the crab toast, black truffle pizza, and ricotta ravioli. Crab toast: 10/10 - the flavors melt in your mouth and the dish tastes even better with the lemon squeezed on top. The rest of the reviews aren't exaggerating how great this dish is. Black truffle pizza: 10/10 - I love anything with truffle but the thin crust and egg really made this pizza standout to me. I crave it!Ricotta Ravioli: 5/10 - it doesn't taste bad by any means but is just very normal and I could have eaten this anywhere else/even made it at home 4/5 stars for the very slow service"
Stephanie D.,"Los Angeles, CA",2/15/2022,5 star rating,"Came here for a business dinner and had a great time. I would absolutely recommend this for a group, or even just for a date night out!The ambiance is pretty cool in the restaurant, with distinct white furniture illuminated by great mood lighting. The high ceilings with exposed beams really added to the ambiance too.Our server was extremely helpful with recommendations, as we ended up ordering a bunch of wine and shared appetizers. We ordered the peekytoe crab toast, Long Island fluke tartare, and kale salad to share. All of the ingredients were fresh and flavors complex. In particular, I loved the crab toast with buttery bread and fresh crab! For my entree, I enjoyed the duck breast, which was beautifully prepared and well proportioned. I usually never order duck but felt inspired by the mushroom dashi. It lended a great umami to the dish. I would definitely come back."
Bob E.,"Kips Bay, Manhattan, NY",12/9/2022,1 star rating,Wow ... good food .. however we just sat and waited 2 hours from the time of ordering and receiving our food ... at a time when the restaurant was not overcrowded .... there really was no reason for the painful delay nor should the customer have to figure out what was the cause of delay. The front line service people offered several apologies ... when it was time to pay and add the tip ..  and it really wasn't their fault .... but absolutely terrible service from a restaurant that charges premium prices and represents themselves as an upper tier restaurant. I felt like I was at Friendly's. A terrible experience that left all of us feeling ripped off.
Allison H.,"Los Angeles, CA",9/29/2022,5 star rating,"Food was delicious, everyone loved what they ordered and the space is beautiful - calm and intimate with a slight chic but not too minimalist interior."
Emma M.,"NY, NY",12/8/2022,5 star rating,A very nice and fancy restaurant with a great atmosphere. The aesthetic was perfect for a date.
Alice R.,"Manhattan, NY",1/23/2022,4 star rating,"Date night before a Rangers game was here. I didn't have all the much to eat all day so I was a bit famished. We got the following:Crab toast: delicious! My date let me have 3/4 pieces (so romantic). It is a very simple dish where lumps of crab meat are placed on top of toasty bread with some aioli or sauce that you squeeze lemon on top. My date and I both think it is not necessary to put much work in a dish if you're using simple ingredients. I really loved this dish. Sort of craving it now... *****Sea bass: the show stopper of this dish is the yellow chunks on top that are actually compoted lemon rinds. It was cooked in a way that had a cooked potato texture. I had to have my date try it so I put a bit of everything on a spoon and he agreed. ****Kale salad: this was good for what it was, but I just dont like kale in general so my date finished this dish while I worked on the crab toast **Pear mylk punch: it tasted like Xmas morning, but I was not all that a fan of super sweet drinks. Overall, the drinks here is just okay for me. It was hard to find a cocktail that met up to my standards, but they did give me a buzz. I eventually got a gin based drink that I asked to replace with their vodka lemonade and it was like a fancier mimosa. It was okay, but just like a mimosa, they are very filling. I've had brunch here before by myself and I liked it then too. I was blown away by the first dish because of the crème fraise moment they had there. However, think this place was a bit more special and romantic last night because of my sweet date! Perfect romantic date night spot in my opinion! Also, can't really go wrong with Jean George!"
Flora H.,"New York, NY",6/21/2022,3 star rating,"*** 3.5 stars ***A bit loud, and the tables a bit close together, ABC Kitchen is still a very beautiful upscale spot that would be good to take someone that you are trying to impress. I really liked it here, but I did find the food to be a bit salty (yellowfin tuna crudo, fresh chili oil, crushed fennel seed & steamed black sea bass, roasted mushrooms and asparagus ginger-scallion condiment basil and lime). Don't get me wrong, everything was beautiful and the experience was wonderful, I just found the food to be lacking (definitely not bad, just not great) to live up to the ambiance."
Jessalyn S.,"East Bronx, NY",1/7/2022,4 star rating,Abc kitchen is great casual dinner date and the cocktails are sooo good. The restaurant is much larger in the inside than it looks on the outside. Very spacious and the tables are a good distance from each other.The waiter was incredible nice and gave really good recommendations. All the cocktails were delicious and we had to get a couple rounds to try them all. My favorites were the pear milk punch which sounds really weird but tastes very good. The smoke fig sour was yum as well. The waiter suggested we get the roast carrot and avocado and I was hesitant at first because it sounded plain but it actually really delicious. It's more savory than it sounds. The crab toast was good but nothing out of the world. My favorite dish was the black truffle pizza. It was SO good. We ended up ordering a second after finishing the first. It's a must of you go.
Douglas Z.,"New York, NY",9/23/2022,4 star rating,"I enjoyed my meal at ABC kitchen, despite it not being my usual type of meal. Everything tasted fresh and clean, with unique flavors.If you are eating here, make sure to get the chocolate cake with malt ganache & toasted marshmallow meringue. It is truly special, with various textures."
Emily M.,"Bloomsburg, PA",12/10/2022,5 star rating,Amazing vibes & food. We got the crab toast for an app & I got the sword fish for my meal. So yummy!
Sharanika A.,"Brooklyn, NY",12/24/2021,4 star rating,My review is actually like 4.5 stars. I wish I could give it 5 stars but we were freezing all night. There's no insulation in the building and we even moved our seats but staff did little to help us get warm. So I ordered tea lol. It was also half empty so maybe they rely on it being full to be warmer? Food was excellent as expected. Everything was beautiful and filled with fresh fruits and vegetables. The crab toast was delicious as expected and so was the sashimi. My favorite was the citrus salad which contained pretty much all of the citrus fruits imaginable! For our mains I got the fried chicken which I never do but it was quite light and lovely with the habanero sauce. My friend got the sea bass which was cooked to perfection and had a very rich soothing broth. We both ordered panna cotta for dessert but was already too full to enjoy the cranberries and biscuits (?) that come with it. I also got the ginger lime soda--yum!I'll definitely be back but wearing a thick sweater and layers next time!
Sarah M.,"Manhattan, NY",2/19/2022,4 star rating,"We had weekend brunch here recently. This is a busy and noisy place, but with a lively and fun feel. We got seated right away for our reservation.The breakfast potatoes in particular were really tasty--much better than an average side dish at brunch. My friend's crab toast was a nice portion with a lot of crab. The dutch baby was tasty and a different take on breakfast food.Everything tasted great! The service was just a bit spotty. One of our entrees did not come out right away, and it took a while to get our server's attention to get this corrected. Otherwise, we enjoyed our experience and would return."
Said E.,"Edgewater, NJ",6/15/2022,3 star rating,"I was there for a business lunch and I'm surprised that this restaurant has so many good reviews. To be fair, the restaurant has an amazing ambiance but it's very loud and the food is mediocre at best (and way overpriced for the quality of the food). I had crab toast (meh), sea bass (very disappointing, overcooked and way too salty), cappuccino (passable) and peach shortcake (original but just passable and way too sweet for a dessert that the waitress claimed to be a refreshing summer dessert). TLDR; worth visiting once but not a good restaurant with so many amazing options right around the corner."
Carol W.,"FRESH MEADOWS, NY",12/26/2021,4 star rating,"I had Saturday brunch at ABC Kitchen in a party of 5. We made a reservation so we didn't have to worry about waiting and were seated pretty quickly. There were a lot of interesting menu items so we ordered a bunch of different things for the table.Mushroom pizza - the flavor was okay, it was pretty oily so the crust got pretty soggy and all the toppings kind of fell off.Pistachio babka - really fragrant, highly recommend!Dutch pancakes - also really good with a custard-like texture Chicory salad - I got this cause of the figs but I would probably skip it next timeFrench fries/bacon - both fine, kind of what you would expectI really liked the ambience at ABC Kitchen and would really recommend it for a nice brunch in the city!!"
Annalise W.,"Brooklyn, NY",10/23/2021,4 star rating,"This review is for brunch only. Had a 1:30pm reservation on a Saturday and the restaurant wasn't too full. The restaurant itself is beautiful. Love the decor and the ambiance - this is a perfect place for a cute friend brunch. Service was fine as well. The food was pretty good. Nothing I would necessarily crave or go out of my way to come back for, but it was tasty enough, that the food on top of the ambiance would bring me back again. The menu on their website is a little different than what they actual serve FYI (eg: online has blueberry babka, but it wasn't on their actual menu) - this was disappointing. They also were sold out of the doughnuts which was disappointing. I ordered:-Baked Eggs: this was pretty good and surprisingly filling. Downside, I thought they were stingy with most of the toppings (bacon and sweet potatoes). It also had sliced jalapeños on top which the menu didn't list and I took off. -Peekytoe Crab Toast: this was good!-Side of Fries: these were good! Some crispy, some not but very good. -Spinach Goat Cheese Pizza: friend ordered this and she enjoyed. They definitely don't hold back on the spinach (it comes with A LOT). She said the pizza has kick to it -  they put red chili flakes on it."
Meaghan G.,"Jersey City, NJ",5/30/2022,4 star rating,"My friend made a reservation for brunch this past Saturday and we were seated right away. I ordered the soft boiled eggs, which comes with a side of toasted sourdough bread and she ordered the carrot and avocado salad with a side of chicken. We shared the crispy potatoes with garlic aioli. I really liked my dish - it was very refreshing and reminded me of a fancy deconstructed egg salad. My friend really enjoyed her salad dish and although salads typically aren't too filling, this one was filling enough that she had leftovers. We both enjoyed the potatoes - they were super crispy and well seasoned and the garlic aioli paired perfectly. The restaurant is decorated very nicely and has a really nice atmosphere. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others!"
Dipesh H.,"Miami Beach, FL",11/20/2022,4 star rating,Good food and atmosphere. Great service and friendly. Accommodating. Very busy and noisy. But we could hear each other across the table. Not sure how that worked? I'd go back.
Alaina B.,"Syracuse, NY",8/11/2022,5 star rating,"Phenomenal food! I would recommend the duck and crab toast. They also have a great variety of drinks, there is something for everyone. It has a beautiful atmosphere and would be great for any occasion. Can't wait to go back!"
Gina G.,"Hayward, CA",9/23/2022,5 star rating,"The food here is phenomenal! I got the margherita pizza. Our party ordered duck , fried chicken, fries, and the brown butter cake.  Sooo good! The fries are to die for. The waiters and waitresses are nice and helpful. They took my coconut water when I had a sip left but was gone before i could say anything lol. My only suggestion would be to ask if they can take your food away first but it's ok, really great experience here!"
Jessica C.,"Brooklyn, NY",2/4/2022,4 star rating,"The food and drinks here were great! I tried most of the appetizers, the black truffle pizza, the scallops, and the Sea Bass. Although each scoop I had was great, I was dying to reorder the Peekytoe Crab Toast and the Long Island Fluke Tartare. There was a sweetness to the crab toast that gave it sweet and savory taste and made me request another round for the table mid-way through the meal. The tartar was also delicious but instead of sweetness, the standout flavor in this dish some tangy citrus. For drinks, I mostly stayed with wine but I do recommend the ginger margarita. Overall, I would return here in a heartbeat and I hope the crab toast is still on the menu ."
Jessica Y.,"New York, NY",1/23/2022,3 star rating,"I went to abc kitchen for my bday with 3 friends on a Sunday night 7pm. The restaurant was pretty quite. We were able to  enjoy a nice quite dinner with great ambiance. The hostess was very friendly.

Chris And Tanja B.,"New York, NY",12/13/2022,2 star rating,"We had a group of about 10 people and honestly had some of the slowest service I have ever had in New York.  At this price point they need to be on it and not only did they take over 15 minutes to take our drink order, they also brought our first round of drinks after our mains arrived.... Food was ok but again I would say at this price point the service needs to greatly improve and I would expect a little more on the food quality as well."
Megha M.,"Queens, NY",8/3/2022,5 star rating,"My team hosted a small dinner here, and everything was perfect. The table setting, the servers, the attention to detail, and ofcourse food. We had a pre fixed sort of menu that included some amazing salads, chicken/fish for the main course, followed by a delicious dessert. We were sitting in a corner with very nice table setting and it wasnt too loud. Highly recommend for celebrations and group events."
Alec C.,"Downtown Jersey City, Jersey City, NJ",7/25/2021,5 star rating,"I went to ABC Kitchen for brunch on a Saturday. It wasn't too crowded, but was fairly busy by the time I left. The ambience of the restaurant is excellent. Tables are spacious and each table is distanced generously from other tables. Lighting and atmosphere are also good. The staff is courteous and attentive. We tried three dishes. The first dish we tried was the crab toast. It was crab served on crunchy toast with a lemon to squeeze on it. It was an excellent dish and I would order it again. We also had the strawberry compote with bread. The compote is served with some ricotta cheese as well to form a less viscous jam when mixed with the strawberry compte. The strawberry compote was flavorful, but I would probably pass on it if I came to ABC kitchen again for brunch. Finally, we had the Dutch pancake. I had never had a Dutch pancake before, so I didn't know what to expect. It was incredibly fluffy and tasty when combined with the provided lemon and syrup.I'm very curious to try ABC kitchen again for their other dishes. Among the places I have visited in NYC so far, I would definitely put ABC kitchen among the best that I have experienced so far."
Caroline D.,"Brooklyn, NY",1/13/2022,5 star rating,"Two words - crab toast. This is simply one of the best dishes that I've ever had, and something that will keep me returning to ABC Kitchen for as long as they offer it. The rest of the menu is great too - it's seasonal and highlights the freshest of ingredients - same with their cocktail list which is always evolving (the vodka thyme lemonade is one of my all time favorites).  I typically make a reservation, but sometimes they can squeeze in walk ins. It's also conveniently located in ABC Home so you can shop while you wait!"
Alina H.,"Jackson Heights, Queens, NY",12/15/2021,5 star rating,"As a Jean Georges restaurant, expectations were understandably high and ABC Kitchen did not disappoint! Ambiance was great, service was excellent and the food was even better!Truffle Pizza: Neither of us is a big fan of fried eggs, so we opted to leave off the cracked egg topping the pizza. The size was perfect for 2-3 people to share as a starter and the flavors were excellent. My only wish was that NYC pizzerias served it in the standard size so i could have boxes delivered to my apartment on a weekly basis. Sea Bass: By far my favorite item. It was so flavorful and fresh. The preserved lemons and pairing with baby potatoes and spinach complimented the natural flavors. It was also cooked to perfection with a wonderful flaky flesh and crispy seared crust. Fried Chicken: While I was really into the aesthetics and the unique take on fried chicken, the puffy crunch crust was the best part of the chicken. the meat itself was a little fatty and I felt it needed a bit more seasoning. The sauce underneath complimented the plainness of the chicken, but the blanched greens had no seasoning at all (including salt).For dessert we ordered the chocolate cake, panna cotta, and were surprised with a mini caramel popcorn sundae as a complimentary birthday treat. This was very sweet of the staff. All desserts were good, but did not match the creativity and the flavors of the dinner dishes. We also ordered wine and the citrus and sage cocktail which paired great with the light flavors of the food. Overall, the restaurant was fabulous and did a great job of maintaining safety standards and quality service. Will certainly be back for a restaurant week or other special occasion."
Minna C.,"Manhattan, NY",6/16/2021,4 star rating,"My friend made a reservation for 2pm on a Saturday and the place was packed! We were starving and ordered the Crawford cheddar biscuits, peekytoe crab toast, truffle pizza, and their cardamom Dutch baby pancake. We also got the lemon thyme mocktail which was refreshing with a light lingering taste of thyme which paired well with all of our savory dishes. The biscuits were flaky and buttery balls of perfection and their peekytoe crab toast had a generous amount of fresh crab. The star of the show was their truffle pizza with a farm egg on top. It was large enough to share with the perfect amount of truffle oil and cheese. The only disappointing part of the meal was the cardamom Dutch baby pancake. It was a little burnt and was slightly bitter. They also used quite a large amount of cardamom which also left quite an unpleasant taste in our mouths. They were kind enough to comp us the pancake since we couldn't eat it at all. This is a great place for brunch and drinks! Check out my foodsta @chiuventure for a closer look and more details of my dining experience here as well as other establishments in NYC and around the world!"

Julie L.,"Houston, TX",12/13/2021,3 star rating,"It took us a while to find the restaurant because of a tiny sign. The food here was mediocre but enjoyed the candlelight, pretty flowers atmosphere. We were told by our waiter that the restaurant does not offer complimentary birthday dessert. we would have to order desserts and he will put a birthday candle on top."
David H.,"Encino, CA",9/24/2022,3 star rating,Service is great and the atmosphere is nice.  Everything about the food is really good EXCEPT the salt content.  Too much salt in almost everything!  Beautiful lobster roll with too much salt sprinkled on top.  Fries and chips with way too much salt. Pizza is too salty.  They should call this place ABC Salt.
Ken M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",5/22/2021,5 star rating,"Summary: solid food. We came here because we are Jean Georges/Nougatine fanatics and wanted to see if we could taste his handprint hereTaste: the food was awesome. Compared to a typical restaurant that looks like this or serves similar menu items this place is clearly distinguished. I would say nougatine is still a tier above, but you can tell this is jg's handiwork as the flavor profiles are nuanced 1. Pretzel crusted calamari: calamari heaven. We sat down hungry and this hit the spot. The sauce that it comes with is amazing. The serving size is good for two people 2. Fluke tartare: also very good tartare - light and refreshing but also flavorful. Portion is a bit light so suitable for just a single person or at most two 3. Black Sea bass: good; nice and light but still flavorful. Served in a translucent broth that seems to be chicken based and added with yuzu. The overall portion is on the smaller side so if you're looking for comfort food then I'd recommend the burger 4. Burger: this is in the top 2-3 burgers I've had in New York. The patty was very juicy and tender, and the vinaigrette dressing on the lettuce cut through the fat and cheese very well. A filling portion for sure. The fries were also cooked nicely Drinks: cocktails here were AMAZING. Do not skip this!1. Rhubarb milk punch: I always order milk punch whenever I see it on a cocktail menu. For those who don't know what milk punch is, it's brandy or rum aged with milk and clarified with certain ingredients to remove the more harsh tastes from the alcohol. The result is an extremely smooth and sweet drink with clear color2.  Mezcalita: this was probably my favorite. Just a very well executed mezcalita; easy to drink3. Spring herb 75: this was really good too! Served in a champagne glass. Has a lot going on in terms of complex flavor profile but can be summarized as a sweet, fruity and slightly bubble drinkValue: on the pricier side but worth it. Our check for two people with the above came out to $190 after tax before tipAtmosphere: the main dining area is dimly lit with candles - honestly a really cool experience. This restaurant is actually connected to a bougie furniture store and has this unique rustic aesthetic Frequency: will definitely be back for the calamari, burger, and cocktails. I can see myself coming back once every 2-3 months"
Angelica N.,"Tallahassee, FL",10/25/2022,3 star rating,"The peeky toe crab & almost all of their desserts are phenomenal. However when I was there last month I ordered the duck breast & it came out extremely undercooked (almost raw). I didn't realize this in the low lighting, but shortly after taking the first bite I completely lost my appetite. They did afterwards bring me out a plate of the duck that was properly prepared but of course my whole family had already finished eating by the time this was done & after the feeling & taste of raw duck in my mouth I no longer was hungry."
Paulina Z.,"New York, NY",11/13/2021,1 star rating,"Pretty disappointed by this place. The service was sorely lacking. We came here for brunch and ordered the calamari, the crab toast, and the lobster. It took more than 10 minutes after sitting for our server to come and give us our menus. The service was very perfunctory, they didn't check on us at all except to refill our drinks occasionally. The worst part is that I've been having health issues. One of the side effects is hair loss AKA shedding. The server was noticeably grossed out as they were clearing the table and saw a few of my stray hairs on the plates. It may be not super fun but I don't think it was okay for them to say, ""ew, a hair"" aloud. It was clearly my hair and I apologized for it but I didn't feel great about it. They also did not respond to my apology which made me feel worse.The food was mediocre - the crab toast was pretty fishy and the calamari wasn't evenly breaded. The lobster was fine but not worth it at the market price. It was not especially unique. I would not recommend this place."
Maya N.,"New York, NY",5/1/2021,4 star rating,OK so the service just happened to be terrible this time but it is usually pretty good. However the Seabass was consistently bad. Overall a great place to eat if you want to do small plates and tapa style with a group but I do not recommend any of the Entrees. Overall it is fairly anti-inflammatory and relatively healthy with good taste. A good place to break your fast in Ramadan and the music is always 80s vibes
Sigmund S.,"Bronx, NY",10/9/2022,5 star rating,"Good food plan to return. The fried chicken, pasta, and duck (though a small portion according to my dining friend) were all yummy. The apple Ala mode and chocolate cake were fab. My one critique was the supetbdim lighting really  made reading the menu and seeing the food hatd."
Ina M.,"Hackensack, NJ",10/12/2021,4 star rating,"Nice ambiance, tasty drinks, and great desserts! That green juice cocktail was amazing. Felt healthy! Haha. The desserts were great. Tasty, but not overly sweet. Just a right balance. Would come back again."
Vickie L.,"Houston, TX",12/3/2021,3 star rating,"I came here with a group of 5! The tables are very long and makes it easy to eat comfortably with the amount of space available. The atmosphere is very candle lit date night vibes. Our service was top notch! However, the food was pretty mediocre. But I will say the crab toast was my favorite!"
Andrew M.,"New York, NY",12/1/2022,5 star rating,"Great food, especially the crab toast. There was also a fish dish that came in some broth that was excellent but I don't remember the name. Can't wait to go again."
Frank A.,"Manhattan, NY",9/20/2021,5 star rating,"Just stopped in for a late Sunday evening supper after cocktails nearby and ABC Kitchen did not disappoint. The crab toast was amazing as always. We also had some pizza, pasta and the ice cream sundae, it was all great."
Benny R.,"New York, NY",6/10/2022,4 star rating,"Dropped by here for an after-date drink and sat at the bar. What intrigued me was the cool, yet welcoming vibe. I went at night so the lights were kinda dim  (kinda hard to read the menu).  The bartender was friendly and the dining room looked busy. Would come again to try the food. Bar seats were slightly uncomfortable, though.  The place seemed a little one-note in terms of clientele, mainly millennial and gen x folks."
Shreya B.,"New York, NY",5/27/2022,4 star rating,"I came here for dinner with my cousins and had a lovely time. I think people come here for the ambience, dim lighting, string lights, floral arrangements, and long tables for larger parties. We ordered 2 pizzas (a spinach and goat cheese + a mushroom pizza), both which were pretty good. We also ordered ravioli, straciatella cheese which came with pita bread, and a kale salad. The portions are very small, so keep that in mind while ordering. We also ordered drinks which were quite tasty! While I won't say it was the best food I ever had, the experience was what made it a 4 star review in my mind. Staff was also very courteous!"
Sarah Y.,"Washington, DC",9/20/2022,2 star rating,We went as a group of 6 and tried over 10 dishes. 2/3rds of the dishes were so salty my throat felt parched. The prices are outrageous for the tiny amount of mediocre food you get. The only good thing was the decor and great service.  Honestly shocking how busy it was on a Tuesday night...
foodfoodfood f.,"Portland, OR",9/11/2022,5 star rating,"Brunch was absolutely delish. It was really hard to choose between savory or sweet - there were three kinds of fresh-baked goodies and cardamon pancakes... and did I mention all the dessert, like the peach shortcake and milk chocolate layer cake? Coffee was weak but the crispy potatoes with aioli were addictive and I loved the egg sandwich with sumac hot sauce and fontina."
malakial j.,"Kailua, HI",3/24/2022,5 star rating,"While I have eaten at ABC Kitchen many times, I had never been to brunch there until this last weekend. There were so many things I wanted to try and I changed my mind 100 times before deciding on the Dutch Baby and crispy bacon. The bacon came out very quickly, while understandably the Dutch Baby came out much later. It was delicious! The only problem with my meal is that it left me so full that I had no room left in my stomach and wasn't able to order my favorite sundae afterwards. Oh well...next time."
Abhishek M.,"Long Island, NY",8/29/2021,4 star rating,"I wish I could give 4.5 stars! The only reason it wasn't a full 5 stars is because, for the price ($21), I was expecting a much more flavorful hollandaise sauce on my eggs Benedict. I did switch out the ham for sautéed spinach, so maybe with the ham it would have been better. The blueberry babka bun and the baked eggs were absolutely delicious! And the chocolate layer cake and the peach tarte tatin were also excellent. Often chocolate layer cakes taste like ganache on Betty Crocker cakes, but the sponge itself had amazing flavor. I came out very full and very happy :) For the cocktails, we had the ginger margarita and the Paloma, which were good, but the salting of the rims was a little aggressive. I was also very happy to be introduced to Banyuls dessert wine which I cannot wait to buy a bottle of!"
Marines M.,"Manhattan, NY",6/1/2022,3 star rating,"I've always liked this place and continue to think it's a good spot for food.  However, today's visit was a bit disappointing on the service side .... primarily because of the very long wait between appetizers and entree.  They did explain they had a very large party on the top floor and they were really busy in the restaurant as well.  We were a big party of 10+ so maybe it was just to much for them to accommodate.  Getting back in the swing of things after Covid may not be an easy thing.What I've had ...Yellow Fin Tuna Crudo ... very fresh fish with a tangy sauce.  Would have liked a preparation where the fish would've had time to absorb more of the flavors of the sauce, but it was good.Peekytoe Crab Toast ... amazing dish with lots of flavor and a sauce that is not overly creamy so you can still get the freshness of the crab.  Black Sea Bass with Chilies and Herbs ... the fish was good although a bit bland, but the bed of wild mushrooms it was served over was SPECTACULAR  I'm a huge fan of mushrooms so this may be tipping the balance for me, but it was such a good side of vegetables.Service in general is good.  As mentioned before, the main issue was just the backlog and delays they were having in the kitchen.  One thing that was a bit strange is that even after the long wait no apologies for the very long delay or any type of ""gesture"" to make up for the inconvenience.  They're usually good so something was definitely off today.Ambiance ... really elegantly casual.  Great setting for large parties because of all the space they have.  It's one of those out of the norm NYC restaurants where you're not crowded with other diners and it's a nice ample dining room.  Open kitchen which I always like as it really adds to the experience. Hence, overall my review is OK.  I do hope they get their mojo back for lunch services as this has always been a go to place."

Jaycee C.,"New York, NY",7/21/2022,3 star rating,"Having grown up in California, this place is somewhat amusing to experience.  The best way that I can describe it is an elevated Sweetgreen.  Think paltry portions, overpriced, oversold on freshness and seasonality and organic and whole-wheat (and insert more trendy diet-related adjectives of choice that California's health/wellness/fitness industry popularized), and ultimately unsatisfying if not dissatisfying.  I got two appetizers and am glad I didn't get more though the portion size are, in Sweetgreen-fashion, paltry.  You can really only get away with such small portions when the ingredients and execution are top-notch and neither happened here.  The tuna crudo was not that fresh, poorly sliced, strangely over-salted, and lacked any level of umami though it was swimming in chili oil.  The housemade stracciatella was not bad, only because I always love a good fresh cheese, but you pay $24 for a generally good fresh cheese with some seeds and micro greens on top served with normal wheat pita bread.  Frankly, I could've put together both myself after a Wegman's trip.  That said, though, the Reviver cocktail is pretty good.  Fresh, complex, herbaceous, and earthy all at once.  If you're here for good drinks and are okay snacking on overpriced Sweetgreen for pretended health reasons this place is for you.  I also don't get the rickety, thin chairs diners are forced to sit on.  Scandinavian flair as an excuse to save on costs, in my opinion."
Amanda D.,"Baldwin, NY",10/5/2021,5 star rating,"Finally got a chance to dine here and couldn't complain. The staff (at least the ones I interacted with) were very warm and friendly. This place is def on the pricier side but its  bc you're paying for the ambience more than anything. To start, we got the pretzel dusted calamari which was so crispy && def how calamari in other restaurants should be served. The mustard aioli that came with it was different for me but still tasty nonetheless. For our entree, our waitress recommended to us the fried organic chicken, the burger & the salmon (as her top 3 faves in that order). I went with the fried organic chicken which I thought wouldn't be be enough but It was. The chicken was cooked to perfection and very juicy. The batter was the right amount and added the perfect crunch. Now the butter on the plate seemed like a lot but It actually wasn't and I LOVE spice so the habanero was a nice kick. Think elevated chicken nugget with this dish. My friend got the salmon which she also enjoyed -- however it did have an overpowering cumin taste. For dessert we opted for the apple tart tatin which is basc like an apple pie but the apples are on top instead of inside. I'm not a dessert fan but I enjoyed this a lot. Overall the place was nice to dine in and is def a nice date spot. I'll def be back to try other items on the menu like that burger."
Sugeidy P.,"North Riverdale, NY",8/15/2021,5 star rating,Love love love coming here. I come here often for lunch and dinner.The drinks the food. Everything is soo FRESH. It is absolutely magical.See you soon ABC Kitchen
Sevon B.,"Brooklyn, NY",4/24/2022,4 star rating,"This was my first time at ABC kitchen for date night with a friend. We started with drinks, a sparkling strawberry cocktail and rhubarb lavender fizz. Both were good and refreshing. Price range for cocktails anywhere from $16-$20. For appetizer I chose the peekytoe crab toast and my friend decided on the kale salad with asparagus. The toast was absolutely divine. The bread was toasted well with crab and a few drops of butter on top. After adding a squeeze of lemon onto the crab which was the perfect amount of zest, I devoured and savored every bite. For entree my friend chose the steamed Black Sea bass with roasted mushroom, asparagus, and a ginger-scallion condiment. I had my eye set on the grilled faroe island salmon with Yukon gold potato salad, grilled ramps, and green chili. The green chili was a bit intense in flavor but when you take a piece of the salmon, ramps and potato together it compliments each other well. The size of entree is a decent portion for one person with a price range of $28-$40. However, if you've come with an appetite I would suggest going for an appetizer to start. Of course my favorite part of the night was dessert. We chose the cookie plate and one scoop of the white coffee stracciatella , caramel, and smoked vanilla ice cream. The cookie plate consisted of cherry blossom sable, mint chocolate crinkle, lemon lavender macaron, snickerdoodle, and brown butter chocolate chip. I would give a 6/10 due to my personal preference of cookies. The brown butter was a little salty for me and I did not enjoy the inside of the snickerdoodle which tasted like it may have had a touch of matcha. However, the lavender macaron tasted light and perfect in flavor. I am not sure whose hands blessed the ice cream cream combination but it was the best ice cream I have had in a while. It was hard to not lick the plate in a public setting. Lol The only critique I would offer would be for customer service. Before we could take off our coats to sit the waiter came over and began to do a run down of the menu. I would have preferred to be settled in first. Finally, when we were ready to pay we waited about 20 mins for the waiter to come over. So long in fact that another person graciously took care of it for us instead. During our dinner we were asked how everything was with our dishes and I always appreciate that in a new restaurant I try. It is very busy in ABC so I can understand that it is difficult to attend to everyone in a timely fashion so I will certainly give grace on that end. Overall I enjoyed my experience at ABC kitchen."
Amanda K.,"Miami, FL",7/20/2022,5 star rating,So so so good! I have a wonderful meal at ABC. I can still taste it. I highly recommend this NYC spot. I only wish I had come here sooner. Don't hesitate to go for brunch.
Mindy L.,"New York, NY",3/17/2022,4 star rating,"I've been wanting to try this place out for a while, partially cause I saw a photo of its crab toast ahah! We came here one Friday night and got the crab toast, fries, and two pizzas (along with some beverages). I ordered the black truffle pizza and I think that was the highlight of the meal! The crust was thin and oozing with cheese and the egg! The only one thing was that I thought it was too oily for my liking but great flavor!"
Elle W.,"New York, NY",7/29/2021,4 star rating,"Ive been here several times both pre and post covid (wait are we even considered post covid yet). It's a great date spot with decent food.I always get the peekytoe crab toast. Their pizzas/flatbreads are also good.Since the pandemic they have merged their menus across the three restaurants (kitchen, Cocina, and abcV) so we got to try dishes from each place, which was quite cool. From their vegan restaurant, I would recommend the hummus! It comes with crudite and everything tastes so fresh and wonderful."
N P.,"Fulton, GA",9/9/2022,3 star rating,"Having been a regular patron at this place, i used to have very high regards.  ABC used to have impeccable quality of food and service - a standard that I used tell other should match.  However, lately both the service and quality of food has gone down.  The veggie burger with pita bread today was very disappointing.  The pita bread seemed like it was grilled in a bed of oil.  I still have the oil after taste.  The service has also gone down.  We we're served the main course followed by starters followed by bread for the table.  Did not expect the service to go down with a change in managers."
Soyoung P.,"San Francisco, CA",9/6/2022,5 star rating,"love this place and food. However, I was disappointed to find out they were out of the topping we had ordered after eating and asking them. They kindly said well that we shouldn't pay for the topping without asking our preference of choice."
Victoria R.,"San Diego, CA",7/30/2021,3 star rating,I was really excited to try this place after hearing so many good things about it especially dessert. The restaurant is really beautiful. Started off with crudo & traditional pizza- in my opinion best things I ate all night. For mains- burger; if I remember correctly it has a taziki sauce which completely throws off the burger. Other Main which must have been seasonal was some kind of stew- really not memorable. Dessert was just ok. We got the caramel popcorn sundae and the chocolate layer cake. I was really excited for dessert so this was a big disappointment. I wasn't crazy about any of the drinks we ordered and they were on the higher price side. Overall I thought this restaurant was just ok. I probably won't return. Service was ok. In my opinion slightly overpriced especially the drinks. With an average cocktail price of $18- in my opinion drinks should be elevated and spot on. That was definitely not the case here.
Kim T.,"New York, NY",11/27/2020,2 star rating,"I used to really like this place before covid. Came last night for thanksgiving 3 course prix fixe for $128. The service was so disorganized with multiple servers serving our table. Our main server was soooo bad I was about to walk out at one point. He literally ordered something for me without even talking to me about it and later claimed I wanted that.... -_-.  Another server fixed it for me after my friend complained. Two different servers also tried to bring me other peoples wine and food, twice! Not to forget my server literally just ordered something for me without my permission! Will never be back again. Thanks but no thanks. Disappointing for $128 for 3 course! My scallop crudo was subpar with such bad sauce mixture. My lobster was cooked well but the sauce made it strange tasting. The dessert was just so so.  Overall Def not worth $128 esp with such irritating and poor service."
Davide D.,"Manhattan, NY",11/7/2022,3 star rating,"First visit to this long established place. It was good, if not a bit routine. Fried chicken was moist and large portioned and the side of mashed potatoes typically of comfort. Tuna ceviche appetizer was also good. A restaurant to return to for a satisfying meal but not one for an excellent meal of surprise and uplift."
K. K.,"Winchester, MA",4/10/2022,2 star rating,"Not very good. The food was quite bland and for the prices you will likely go home hungry. Service was also very poor, had to search for waitress all night to get drinks and water refilled. The drinks were also not very good. Had the Manhattan which was passable and an old fashioned that had crushed ice in? Interior is nice. Using the restroom is a fight with the door and the cramped room. Would recommend spending your 500 to 600 dollars for a party of 5 elsewhere."
Kelsey A.,"New York, NY",1/28/2022,5 star rating,"Such a great spot! I've been obsessed with ABC Cocina for years, and really enjoyed my past visits to ABCV. I'm happy to say ABC Kitchen more than lived up to my expectation. The ambiance is cool, the staff is friendly, and the food and drinks were awesome. I highly recommend the scallops and peekytoe crab toast. The Long Island fluke tartare was much smaller than expected- good, but not as satisfying as the other two. For drinks: although the citrus and sage was too sweet for me, the bell pepper martini was wonderful. My husband also liked the Manhattan. Finally, the much-hyped chocolate cake was a very good chocolate cake, but the apple tarte tatin was the table favorite. This is a great spot for a date night or girls night out. Very classy and hip at the same time."
Jordan W.,"Manhattan, NY",8/3/2021,4 star rating,"We decided to try this spot again after the debacle the first time and thought it was pretty good. The appetizers were amazing, we had the tar tar, calamari, and crab toast. I thought the crab toast and tar tar was best. For the entre, I had the sea bass which I thought was pretty good but not as good as the appetizers. Cocktails were interesting."
Remone R.,"Queens, Queens, NY",11/1/2022,5 star rating,This place was fantastic! I dined at ABC V with a few colleagues and we all enjoyed pretty much everything on the menu. I am not a vegan or vegetarian but I did leave full and wanting to incorporate these meals into my lifestyle

I got the cardamom dutch baby pancakes which were delicious. Had a very unique taste but very hearty for a breakfast. We also got some potatoes and bacon for the table and the bacon was crispy and divine. Loved my strawberry champagne too.

Carmine M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",2/13/2022,3 star rating,"I always loved this place. Somehow it not quite up to par ... Friendliest staff, nice environment and reasonable prices but what happened to the service ? While quite pleasant the staff seem Inexperienced Coffee with no spoon to stir? Bread with no butter? Slightly  cracked coffee mugs? No Splenda?  I also found the salmon plate very tough .. so much so that I needed a knife to cut the veins in it. The flavors are very nice but why use poor quality salmon ? I'll try again but some how I fear it may have lost that shabby chic specialness"
Matthew H.,"New York, NY",6/5/2021,4 star rating,"Quality food, limited menu and not so many vegetarian options (although more than ABCV allegedly). I ordered the roast carrot and avocado salad for my main dish, while it was decent [4/5], it wasn't particularly exciting as a main meal and there weren't a lot of other vegetarian options on the larger side, other than a pasta.Service was woefully slow and not particularly friendly either. I'd give it another chance but I can't say it was as good as I was expecting."
Melody L.,"New York, NY",7/5/2022,5 star rating,"Lovely place! The dessert peach shortcake was amazing, so was the sea bass and crudo! The roasted carrot salad was also very good! Lunch is not as busy, so I do recommend stopping by in the day ~"

Katie B.,"New York, NY",3/13/2021,3 star rating,"ABC Kitchen, you're almost the perfect spot for me to dine with my non-vegan friends! The ambience is amazing, all of their restaurants are very Instagram-friendly. I came here with my sister for a nice dinner and was shocked to see that ABC Kitchen, part of a franchise that has a vegan restaurant (ABC V), didn't have anything ""vegan"" on their menu. You would think that they would understand that adding vegan options makes a really big difference to people who are vegan. It really surprised me. Luckily the waitress was super helpful but when restaurants don't offer a vegan option it usually leads to an unnecessarily painful experience. All three stars go to my waitress because she knew her stuff!Since they don't offer a vegan entrée I ordered more food than I would've liked, spending more money than I would've liked in result. I ended up getting a pizza with no cheese and a salad. The pizza was so thin and small -  there was even a hole in the middle of the dough and it was hard to eat. It was delicious but, for the price, I was surprised. The salad was also super good but definitely not the same without cheese. Both of these options were supposed to have cheese on them which would make them more filling and adds some protein. There wasn't any vegan protein in my meal like a nut-based cheese substitute or chickpeas for the salad. These little details make a big difference to vegans. Our waitress was amazing - she was able to walk me though my options without having to ask. Sometime I can tell the staff doesn't know what vegan means and I'm nervous to get me food - I had zero stress. I also knew that if they messed up my food she would catch it. I wish I could give more stars but our meal was very pricey and I find it ridiculous that a franchise with a vegan restaurant doesn't even have the word ""vegan"" on their menu."
Juan J.,"Beverly Hills, CA",4/19/2022,2 star rating,sad to say that this iconic restaurant has lost it. it had been one of my favorite nyc spots but no longer. save yourself time/money and go elsewhere.Here's why- service is now horrible - reduced menu- items out of kitchen lack consistency (one pizza was half the size of another one served to same table)- menu items are no longer executed to same standard as before and are a mere ghost of what they used to be so sad but i guess they are doing what they can
Aanchal C.,"Los Angeles, CA",6/13/2022,5 star rating,"A classic New Yorker scene. Great food, healthy options, cocktails are divine, and ambience is always a high energy dining experience!

Angela D.,"El Cerrito, CA",4/11/2021,4 star rating,"I came here for a brunch reservation with some friends. The ambience was nice and I enjoyed the food, but as another reviewer pointed out, I was a little disappointed by the lack of vegan options. Although I'm not vegan, I'm lactose and dairy intolerant. Also, I don't like salad, so I felt limited in my options (the pancakes, baked eggs, etc all contained dairy as a main component!). The waiter felt bad for me too when I mentioned this, but I made do with an oat latte, apple cider donuts, a side of bacon, and roasted potatoes. I also took some of my boyfriend's eggs benedict (but just a bit).It was all very good, but I do hope ABC Kitchen expands their menu in the future or trains their waiters on providing recommendations for those with dietary restrictions!"
Angela W.,"Brooklyn, NY",6/8/2022,4 star rating,"Lovely restaurant- once you get past the rude hostesses - (6/7/22 5.30pm). The 3 of them took absolutely ages to check in 2 young women that they knew - all smiles and laughing until they got to me.

You would've got 5 stars had the hostesses been more welcoming."

I really liked the feel of this place as well as it is exquisitely decorated. Didn't have any specific dish that was so stellar to recommend, and it was on the pricier side, but if you are in the area this is a solid choice."
Elena W.,"New York, NY",2/17/2021,5 star rating,"I'm glad indoor dining has resumed in NYC, and I can enjoy the dinner without suffering from the chilly winter. The entrance of the restaurant is very low-key and easy to miss at night. I like the decor and ambience in the main dining room. The food were tasty, and the service was great. I was so full after the dinner. The only downside was the time limit on dining due to limited capacity during the pandemic. Would love to come back again after the pandemic."
Jenn L.,"St. Petersburg, FL",2/26/2020,5 star rating,Obsessed with ABC Kitchen and its part of Jean-Georges Restaurants! Love the ambiance and they also have a furniture /hardware store too!

Darina H.,"Folsom, CA",1/1/2021,5 star rating,"This review if for my lunch experience PRE-COVID19. My friends and I had reservations here (fortunately because there was a line even before they opened). We had a delightful lunch (pre-fixed menu which included appetizer, salad, main entree and dessert). Food was flavorful, I would say New American cuisine. Yes this spot is trendy and fun but I love it! The establishment is a bit pricey but well worth it. Amazing ambiance and the customer service was on point. Check out my pictures!"
Alexandra J.,"Manhattan, NY",1/24/2020,5 star rating,"Winter restaurant week 2020 review.Came in for lunch on a Thursday with 7 coworkers. They gave us a great 8 top table in the corner.  The space was buzzing and quite loud. Even in the corner, we strained to hear each other across the table. Wasn't a huge issue, but just a note if you plan to have any serious chats here. We were all planning to order from the restaurant week menu. We were given menus immediately, but it did take 10 minutes or so for the waiter to come back around, by that point we were definitely ready. From there it was smooth sailing. Apps came out quickly and entrees followed immediately after. We had a 1pm reservation and were out by 2:15 without feeling rushed. Perfect timing for lunch. Everyone loved the food - and the portions were very generous considering the price. The salmon salad was huge, well cooked large piece of fish and beautiful veggies which was surprising. I had the raw fluke (loved the fennel and citrus!) and the portobello sandwich (SO GOOD and spicy and crisp- maybe the best I've ever had).Overall everyone was impressed with food and service for such a low price. Definitely suggest visiting during restaurant week!"
Grace C.,"New York, NY",6/6/2022,3 star rating,"Great ambiance, but mediocre food and service. This place is a classic but too basic. We came here for dinner and was seated quickly. However, it took the servers a really long time to come and take our order. For two people, we got the peekytoe crab toast, gem lettuce, and mushroom whole wheat pizza to share. The crab toast was the only thing that tasted decent, but the crab quality could be better. We had to also wait quite a while before we got the gem lettuce and mushroom whole wheat pizza, which were both way too salty."
V N.,"New York, NY",5/13/2022,2 star rating,"Do, good food, limited menu. However, service is horrible. Don't come on a Cridsy. They are too busy snd don't really care for you or your business. They seem to have plenty."
Tina W.,"New York, NY",1/23/2021,5 star rating,I had heard that they were doing outdoor dining in winter right and I was able to check it out last night and they are!  The space feels opened yet covered and warm. The experience is unique because they are cooking out of all three kitchens and have selections from all menus. All the dishes we had were share-able and delicious. Timing of things were not exactly what I would expect normally but it's to be expected with a limited staff and three different kitchens and one bar. I would recommend this highly to any friends looking for a location near Union Square. And as expected the plates/glasses/cutlery was goals.
Victoria G.,"New York, NY",12/7/2019,4 star rating,"We arrived right at the time that we had reserved, but the hosts told us that we had to wait a while until the table before us finished dessert. We waited for quite a while, around 20 minutes possibly. That was slightly annoying, as I had booked the time and was hungry by then. Anyway, once we were seated, I was happy with the service, environment, and food for sure. The waitress was extremely helpful and attentive, while the dim cozy lighting made me extremely thankful for this meal I was having on Thanksgiving. We ordered dishes from the Thanksgiving set menu, and everything was beautifully put together. My favorite dish would have to be the squash toast appetizer with ricotta. I was completely blown away with how the different textures and flavors melted in my mouth, and I couldn't stop thinking about it the entire night. The meal was great and I had a great time finally checking out this place, which I've had on my list for a few years now!"
Susan J.,"CO, CO",9/23/2021,2 star rating,"Good food. Beautiful decor. Super loud. And comically bad service. Comical. As in- if you don't laugh you will cry!Had to flag down a server to order literally anything. At one point it took 30 minutes to get a glass of wine. Servers told us exactly nothing about the menu and what we were eating. By the way, none of the staff was rude or unkind at all, just inattentive and unresponsive. They also mentioned the bar was having a hard time."
Yifu M.,"Bellevue, WA",9/3/2022,1 star rating,"Bad service. Sat down for half an hour, no water or waiter to help us order anything. Tables came in later than us got faster service. Would recommend avoiding this place"
Zoe L.,"Chester Township, NJ",8/5/2021,2 star rating,"This was our first time back to ABC since the pandemic. I would like to start off saying that the bartender was very professional and kind, something is obviously going on in the kitchen.  The bartender wasn't allowed to put our appetizer order in till we had the whole order. We ordered two apps and two entrees.  The apps came out separately, didn't mind because we we're sharing. Placed the order at 7:50 PM. Finally got one entree ravioli at 9:00 PM which was ice cold.  Kitchen sent out chicken entree at 9:15. The restaurant wasn't busy and there was plenty of staff. No excuse, entrees always come out the same time! This is restaurant 101. Why did the chicken take 1.25 hrs, that's crazy! I expect more from a place like this."

Will definitely return. My only complaint was I wanted more food  because it was so good."
Melissa Z.,"Arlington, VA",9/27/2019,4 star rating,"Love this place!! The servers are very kind and my only real complaint was the uncomfortable chairs. We sat at a high top table with metal chairs and no backs. I don't really get for it being part of a furniture - couldn't we have more comfortable chairs and still be stylish? Anyway back to the food:Escarole - 4/5 very light and a nice touch from the artichokes and sweet nectarines, good clean appCrab toast - 5/5 okay I get why everyone raves about this. Seems simple but it's so lemony and savory and delicious!Sea bass - 3/5 it was good! But not anything special and still expensive. A little spicy but the citrus on top was too sour in my opinionBurger - 5/5 okay I get why everyone love this as well! There was something about the cheese and the pickled jalapenos didn't make it that spicy if you're worried about. Fries were perfectly crisp yext soft!"
Upset M.,"Upper West Side, New York, NY",4/15/2022,1 star rating,"If you are planning an event there beware! I used to love this place so when my parents opted to have my baby shower there I was elated. However, we were disappointed with the service. The food is amazing as always. However, we rented the room in the back for what is supposed to be a private event. It was not until 4 am the morning before that the manager informed us that the door to store ABC would open into our  event room. Our private event became a public event people from the ABC store came wondering through our event. My guests were often interrupted by them asking them where the restroom was. We brought it up to general manager to please put a sign saying ""private event"" to keep off wanderers. However, she quickly dismissed us. The whole event was such a terrible experience despite them charging us a room fee to have the space to ourselves."
Devin G.,"New York, NY",6/25/2021,2 star rating,"We tried to make the best of the situation, but at the end of the meal we were beyond disappointed.I'll start off positive by saying that the service was great - not an issue at all.The ambiance and food on the other hand were really lacking. We had dined here years ago and had a great experience, but this time our entrees were barely warm, very much bland in flavor, and the outdoor dining set up was lackluster in comparison to their sister restaurants.We even asked the party next to us, and although their food was better, they agreed that it didn't compare to past dining experiences."
Nina M.,"New York, NY",4/8/2022,5 star rating,I love their crab toast and caramel popcorn Sundae is one of my favorite desserts ever. Very cute decor and pleasant ambiance. Perfect for dates and weekend brunches.
Dolkar L.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",6/27/2022,4 star rating,"Excellent server, food and drink  was grt, fun and  simple ambiance but need big improvement on desserts for real. Had chocolate cake ( which was so average, had better ones in cheaper price) and panna cotta was good but nothing special. Beside desserts everything else was excellent."
Benjamin H.,"New York, NY",3/14/2022,5 star rating,"I came here for dinner recently and absolutely loved the place! The ambiance is incredible, the food was very good, and the service was the best part (shout out to our server Omar who was amazing - give that man a raise!) Highly recommend it."
Barbara R.,"Marblehead, MA",2/22/2022,5 star rating,"We were able to snag a last minute reservation for Sunday (2/20) brunch. The decor is stunning, the food is divine, and most importantly, our server Allie, was a delight - professional, courteous, and full of personality. One word of advice - save room for the apple cider donuts!"
Howard C.,"Brooklyn, NY",7/21/2019,5 star rating,"Wow. Can't wait to go back. We had a fantastic casual Sunday brunch at ABC and it was one of the most enjoyable meals this summer. Server presentation, pace, taste, space, decor, price, lighting.. hard to describe, they just get it right and you know if you go. The place is enormous but maintains its charm and each section looks like you can get a different dining vibe all within the same restaurant. Menu is full of hits, makes you wish you went with more friends / want to book again to try some other dishes. We ordered 10 different things and it was all fresh, unique, balanced, delicious and well-portioned.ABC has the healthy-tasty food game figured out."
Diana I.,"Torrance, CA",7/13/2019,5 star rating,"This review is long overdue. My friend who lives in NYC suggested we have lunch here and I'm SO glad we did! It's owned by Chef Jean Georges so I knew it was gonna be good! As soon as I stepped inside the dining room, I fell in love. My jaws dropped. What a BEAUTIFUL rustic chic space!! I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE the ambience and decor here!! Great place for a date or a girls night! The three of us shared the Crab Toast, Roasted Carrot & Avocado Salad and their Special that day which was a raviolo. All the food was delicious and beautiful. We enjoyed everything! Service was great! I seriously have zero complaints about this place. I wish they would open one in LA because I would go here all the time!"
Edward M.,"Princeton, NJ",1/1/2022,5 star rating,"Came here with family and really enjoyed the experience.  The service was attentive, but not annoying about it while being really nice.  The cocktails were the highlight of the menu, but the food was also delicious.  I ordered the hamburger with jalapeños and fries, which was really good.  I would definitely suggest bringing friends for their cocktails and bar bites."
Patrick W.,"New York, NY",9/6/2019,5 star rating,"TLDR: New American at Jean George's ABC Kitchen. Modern twists on classic dishes. Fantastic wines, entrees but the $$$$ is spot on.I've been eating at ABC Kitchen for a number of years, I haven't had a chance to try the other ABC sister spots. The restaurant is part of a home store which you'll notice at the back of the restaurant.This is very much a place to be seen. The decor here is beautiful and the food tastes how this place looks, spectacular.If it's your first time, here's my recommendations for a great meal.Crab Toast with Lemon Aioli - It's so simple yet oh so luscious. That lemon aioli just adds to the richness of that sweet crab. Nowadays, who doesn't love anything on toast?!Pretzel Dusted Calamari - I think everyone's had plenty of calamari at some point but that pretzel breading makes this so light. It has that delicate crust that few places seem to accomplish. The two sauces are great, one is a spicy tomato and I think the other is some kind of mustard.Mushroom, Parmesan, Oregano and Farm Egg Pizza - He has similar versions at his other restaurants but this one is my favorite. Let that yolk run over the mushroomy landscape and it's just earthy savory flavors galore. You may want to split an entree if you get one of these - it's quite rich and very filling.Fried Organic Chicken - The breading is so airy and it just crumbles as you slice across the chicken. On a bed of collard greens with hot sauce butter, you can't go wrong with this. Dip every single bite in that butter, it's good for the soul.Akaushi Cheeseburger - This is probably one of my favorite burgers anywhere. The cheese is grated on top as opposed to just a slice across the patty. The fries are fabulous and those peppers give such a lovely kick.ABC has been here for a long time and I trust they'll be here long after. Solid menu that keeps the staples the customers love.The hard part is booking a reservation but fear not, if you walk in on the earlier side - you can snag a bar seat or even a table if you're lucky."
Albert A.,"New York, NY",9/23/2019,4 star rating,"No doubt this is a classy-casual place for dinner. The food was really good for the most part; I would come back. For the price, it's definitely not an everyday restaurant, but good for date night or a special occasion. I had the Crab Toast, Campanelle pasta, and the ice cream (with chocolate sauce and popcorn). Crab Toast: Tasty with a good amount of substance on the toast. For me, the bread was toasted slightly too long; it was a bit hard, but the flavor shined through. The crab topping was creamy and put together nicely. I probably could've eaten 3 slices of this toast. Campanelle: This pasta was absolutely delicious. I only wish I had more of it. The ricotta laid on top of the pasta, waiting for me to spread it around. Once I did, the whole pasta was transformed; it went really nicely with the eggplant and tomatoes. This was an awesome dish. I recommend having the ""entree"" version and getting more of it; I believe I had the smaller ""appetizer"" version. Ice Cream: This was just okay. The candied popcorn was very sweet with the ice cream; I understand that it would probably get soggy if it wasn't candied, but it was a little much in this dish. Next time, I would try the chocolate caPrice: 3/5Quality: 4/5Quantity: 4/5Service: 5/5Atmosphere: 5/5"
Karen M.,"Miami-Dade, FL",7/13/2021,1 star rating,"I was so excited to come here with my family to begin the celebration week of my daughter getting married. It's been the most disappointing meal in New York that I have ever sat down for. We sat down for dinner at 7:20 and ordered drinks. Which came very sporadically. The waitress told us to order everything so it could be spaced out. They finally brought us a salad at 9:20. 2 hours for a salad that didn't have to be cooked. Oh yes... the drink my husband ordered (Pernod)!took them 30 minutes to either locate or they went to purchase it. As I'm writing this, 3 out of 5 orders have been served. I'm still missing my dinner. My ravioli came at 9:30. Not bad. The pizza super salty. Hamburger salty. Sea bass was good. Angelo the manager was very understanding and super apologetic.  We promise to give them a second a chance"
Freeyah-Knycky C.,"Brooklyn, NY",5/12/2019,4 star rating,"I think there are three of them. Three ABCs. I passed through the restaurant of ABC Cocina on my to ABC Kitchen and then the wonderful Emily told me there was also ABCV (the vegan restaurant). ABC Cocina was dimly lit throughout, even making getting to the toilet a serious task on those steps for old four eyes. Back upstairs and had to pass all the couples dining to locate ABC Kitchen and it was like a whole different world. Kitchen is bright and tastefully decorated. (hey there's a decor store above this restaurant, could it be they own errrythang around here?) As I was saying it's chic, modern with a real airy, casual yet elegant feel. From my food selection of crab toast (came highly recommended), calamari and beef burger I enjoyed the burger the best, something I don't say often. Emily said it was some type of special beef but they buried me deep under libations so I cannot to save a life remember a word of what she said about that beef. Emily though, so knowledgeable, accomodating, professional and an overall boss at what she does. Well done sistah! Don't worry, I'ma see your name on my telly soon! Thanks for a wonderful evening. ABC. The End."
Asher W.,"Denver, CO",6/19/2019,5 star rating,"I've literally walked by ABC kitchen every day for 5 years and said ""I've gotta try that place sometime."" ""I've eaten at every other great restaurant in Flatiron, why haven't I been to ABC?""Well the other night we finally made it to ABC Kitchen, and damn do we regret waiting this long. We started at the bar. I had a marg which I asked them to rim with their adobo chili salt. My girlfriend and her mother drank wine. The marg was solid, great kick from the chipotle infused salt. The bar was very nice. We were seated shortly after. Our waitress (though I can't remember her name) was an absolutely sweetheart. Not only was she kind and funny but very knowledgeable and opinionated when it came to the menu. We love opinionated waiters because any smart diner knows that nobody knows the food better than the people who serve it and eat it daily, so we often ask for advice when we are having an internal dilemma while choosing between various delicious sounding dishes. With her expertise we arrived at the starting line with the carrot avo salad and the pea soup. The carrot avo salad was honestly one of my favorite but simplest things of the night. The salad was light yet had a very developed flavor thanks to the cooking of the carrots and the application of some kind of delicious oil, though I couldn't tell what, as well as a healthy hit of acid. The pea soup was light and vegetal but very flavorful and satisfying thanks to the addition of mint. Next we immersed ourselves in the steamed artichoke. This thing was a hoss. It was basically an artichoke, completely bloomed open like a flower, steamed to perfection until the heart was fork tender and the leaves nice and soft, and then filled almost like you would fill a bowl with about a quarter inch of spices and a mustard vinaigrette. It was buttery and acidic and just all around divine. We dipped the leaves in the center well of vinaigrette then demolished the heart. The whole dish is edible so we didnt leave a scrap beyond the spent leaves. Highly recommended. Definitely my favorite dish of the night. My girlfriend and her mother split the ricotta ravioli and the campanelle with spring peas and pistachio pesto. I didn't try the ravioli but the campanelle was quite good. Cooked well and the peas were left only partially pureed, some whole, so it added lots of texture. Textbook pasta dish. I ate the black sea bass with chilis and potatoes at the advice of our waitress. It says it comes in a herb broth, but I would call this more of a fumè. And thats a good thing. This was a perfectly crispy bass in the lightest but most flavorful broth Ive maybe ever had. Perfectly executed with nice globules of glistening fat floating on the surface. My god it was existential. If you're a fish lover (which I'm not necessarily) you must get this. It was easily one of the top 3 fish dishes I've ever had. The fish was so tender and the broth really just set it apart. We ended with the apricot crumble, which was very tasty, sweet but tart from the apricots. And a cookie plate, which I probably would skip next time in favor of some of the more unique desserts on the menu. Overall, service was excellent. The staff were incredibly helpful and kind. The atmosphere was spot on. And we had a lovely dinner. Will absolutely 100% be back soon."
cece b.,"Manhattan, NY",6/21/2022,3 star rating,"First off, this place is lovely in terms of atmosphere and overall vibe. The bar area is a great place to have a cocktail or sample some appetizers. Went here one evening to meet up with former colleagues. It was early in the week -perhaps a Tuesday, and the place was packed. We were seated at a table and the room got darker fairly quickly. The crowd was great but it was difficult to talk due to the acoustics. Our drinks took forever to come -and no one really checked in on us while we waited. So, once the server came back we quickly put our order in since service was slow. Our appetizers also took forever, and were tasty but smallish portions. The rest of our food also took forever and a day-and were good but nothing fantastic. One of us in our party wanted to change out their cocktail because it was wrong , and we had to wait and wait again for someone to come by, we finally flagged someone ! Service here is sorely lacking and does not match the prices. If you want to venture in save yourself the wait and grab a drink at the bar and an appetizer. Not sure if this is Michelin star-if so, they(michelin star peeps)  need to revisit that status asap !  :)"
M W.,"Stamford, CT",11/21/2021,2 star rating,Quality and service used to be unmatched here. Sitting at bar for brunch at this moment. Bar server obviously does not want to be here - no personality or energy or respect. Drink was good. Ordered eggs Benedict and asked the whites to not be runny or undercooked. Served edible but definitely whites were raw and undercooked. All food served on chipped plate. Disappointing.
Jennifer D.,"Toronto, Canada",11/10/2021,4 star rating,The food and service is good. They have an extensive wine list which is great. I recommend the burgers or any pasta they have. Their fried chicken is also really good.
Vrenely M.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",12/21/2021,1 star rating,"I gave it one star because there isn't another option! I went there on the 12th of December and got food poisoning from their raved burger. Four hours after eating, I was throwing up and stuck to the toilet for hours! After reaching out to them to let them know what happened, no one returned my call!! Horrible service! Stay clear of this place!"
Dina K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",3/11/2019,5 star rating,"Came here with my parents for my birthday dinner and would recommend for any occasion-Service: The service needs to be noted here as it's impeccable. It felt like there was a team of servers all dedicated to helping out the table and no matter who you asked to help, all of them were more than happy to help. Food came quickly, everyone was super friendly, and overall very pleasant Food: Where to start?-Cocktails- got the Citrus Sparkler which definitely focused on the champagne. Also tried the sake which was nice, light, and crisp-Calamari- well fried, thoroughly breaded, delicious -Ricotta - great crusty bread and a good portion of the spread-Fluke and Tuna Sashimis- keeping these together but both had their own flavors and were both amazing, recommend for sure -Sea Bass- this was my meal, well prepared, flakey and great portion size. There was a broth in the bowl that was seasoned with thyme and rosemary and was unlike any preparation I've tried before, very good!-Fried chicken- half chicken deboned and cooked tempura style, was very juicy -Ricotta ravioli- classic and good -Chocolate Cake- super moist and flavorful-Cookie Plate- options for everyone!Atmosphere: The overall restaurant is super different. Everything is different yet somehow it all works together (lights, plates, anything). I appreciated the decor and presentation. A bit dark but otherwise great Would 100% return"
Jenn L.,"Jersey City, NJ",7/10/2019,4 star rating,"Came out here for a team lunch reservation. I ordered a Housemade Ricotta Ravioli which was drenched in cheese with a few layers of Ravioli. It was really good, I inhaled that meal in a matter of minutes.I was a bit worried that I would still be hungry because there wasn't a lot of ravioli and I managed to be one of the first ones to finish but I did get full by the end. Partially is most likely due to indulging in bread and family style appetizers prior too. Would rather recommend a burger or something more filling if you're worried about still being hungry.They also offer prefix menus - so I'd probably go for that if I were to go back w/o company pay.Overall, the restaurant has a lovely formal setting and service was great."
Tamira G.,"Brooklyn, NY",5/2/2019,5 star rating,"The Burger! I'm coming back for it !I went here with a friend on Tuesday night.  I would recommend making reservation..that way you can guarantee yourself and your party a seat. Even though we didn't make reservation we were still seated quickly. The hostesses were really sweet and personable.The decor is beautiful, dim lit and intimate in the main dining room. The cafe has an airy look too it. It is different from the main dining room of ABC Kitchen but it is still nice. Our waiter was very knowledgable and gave us great recommendations.We order the campanelle and pesto. I thought it could use a pinch of salt but was pretty good. NOW the burger that I ordered for my main was soo good. Im afraid Im just going to have to return to have it again. My friend ordered the salmon. It got good reviews. The Chenin Blanc is always my go to and is never a disappointment. The ginger lemon soda came in handy since I have a bit of a sore throat. Overall good reviews from me."
Marian M.,"Vicente López, Argentina",7/3/2019,4 star rating,"I did enjoy very much this restaurant! The deco is amazing, the food was really good, it is in the middle of Union Square. We did had 90 minutes waiting, yes it was long but as we were travelling we did some walking around and came back when they called us and our table was ready.Disfrute muchísimo este restaurante! La deco es divina, la comida muy buena, queda en el medio de Union Square. Si tuvimos 90 minutos de espera, si fue largo pero como estábamos paseando, caminamos un poco por ahí hasta que volvimos porque nos llamaron que nuestra mesa estaba lista."
Emily B.,"Bronx, NY",3/7/2020,5 star rating,"Honestly I cannot say enough goods things about the food here. I went with a group of 7 for dinner, we were at a lovely round table which was perfect for conversation. I would definitely recommend making a reservation. There are two entrances, we came through the store on the oposite side. The restaurant is very cool, very nice dinner vibe. The staff was on top of everything and made sure everyone's drink was full and mine was never empty. We started off with some appetizers. The chef prefers when guests order appetizers and main courses at the same time so that's what we did. We got a few crab toasts with lemon aioli (SO GOOD, my favorite dish), kale salad with lemon (delicious, the mint and Serrano chilies are a phenomenal addition and make the salad wonderful), and the tomato mozzarella basil whole wheat pizza (very good and fresh, but I would recommend the crab toast over the pizza). For my main course I chose the Black Sea bass. This was so good!! I cannot put into words how much I enjoyed it. The fish was cooked perfectly and seasoned very well. The potatoes and spinach were a great addition to the fish. And the herb broth added a while new element. I cannot recommend this dish enough, so good! Another popular choice at my table was the ricotta ravioli. I tried it and it was very good, but the Black Sea bass was my favorite. We also ordered the roasted sweet potato (again very good, I did not know what to expect with this and was blown away, great flavor). We also had the house cut fries, which were salted sweet potato fries and they were quite good. And finally, the most important part of the meal, dessert! We got a few different dishes for the table. We chose the chocolate cake, the sundae, the fruit plate, and the cookie plate. I would highly recommend the salted Carmel sundae. You can't go wrong with any option but the sundae was my favorite! Overall, ABC Kitchen was fantastic. My favorite dishes and the ones I would most recommend are: the crab toast, kale salad, Black Sea bass, and finally the sundae."
Jose P.,"Washington, DC",4/16/2019,4 star rating,"After a year we came back to ABC kitchen. I ordered the same dish as last year - bunless burger with a side salad. It did not live up to the one from last year, but still good. I am dropping from 5 to 4 stars for a few reasons. 1. Last year the price for the burger was very high but totally worth it. This year it was still very high priced but it was not as good make it less worth the price. 2. Although all the servers were very nice, we had three different servers. Not sure why they kept shifting but they would always introduce their replacement.  3. The food was still good. 4.  The place is still very nice. Very well decorated."
Kristie P.,"New York, NY",2/17/2019,4 star rating,"Had Valentine's Day dinner super late (around 10:30) last week. Service was a bit slow and it took awhile before we got menus or offered  any water. We went with a bottle of Pinot Noir and some apps - crab toast and the shaved raw fluke. The crab was super fresh and served with a fab of what tasted like mayo. The fluke was absolutely delicious, flavor was well balanced with the horseradish and pieces of apple. For the main course, I went with the ricotta ravioli and my boyfriend had the friend chicken. The ravioli was definitely the best part of the meal. They were so fresh and tasted like they had been made by someone's grandmother! The chicken was definitely crispy though a bit bland. The mashed potatoes were super buttery and smooth. We also ordered the cheesecake, which had some sort of sesame crust and fresh blood orange on top. It was okay but very hard to eat, given how soft the crust was. Decor is beautiful, definitely very romantic dinner!"
Regina S.,"New York, NY",5/17/2021,5 star rating,"This is an incredible, elegant spot near union square. The chef puts his own twist on each dish and they are all incredible. Didn't feel like drinking so I ordered the Red Juice (strawberries, beets, honey) and it was amazing. Don't skip out on starter salads or dessert because they're just as good as the main course and everything is so fresh and healthy that you feel great and energized after. Can't wait to come back!"
Marilyn Y.,"New York, NY",6/16/2019,4 star rating,"Been wanting to come here for a while now and finally made it here last night with my boyfriend for a late dinner around 10 PM! The restaurant itself has a nice rustic ambiance; very farm-chic and romantic. Service throughout was also quick and friendly!We had the pretzel-crusted calamari and tuna sashimi to start - both were delicious!! I was a bigger fan of the tuna sashimi out of the two appetizers - the fish tasted fresh and I enjoyed the sour/citrus-y flavor.For my entree, I had the sea bass, which was replaced with snapper for the evening. I particularly enjoyed the chiles on the dish, and the broth as well! Taking off a star since I actually had wanted to try the salmon, but unfortunately they had sold out of salmon by the time we had arrived. Nevertheless, I hope to be back to try it another time!For dessert, we shared the chocolate cake, and it was the best chocolate cake I've had in a while! I loved the toasted marshmallow icing and the malted chocolate bits. All in all, a great meal! Would expect nothing less of a Jean-Georges Vongerichten restaurant!"
Azy B.,"Hoboken, NJ",6/14/2021,2 star rating,"This restaurant was disappointing - I wouldn't eat here again. The prices were fairish for tapas in the city (maybe on the higher end) but the portions were ridiculously small. My friend and I spent $150 here (included 4 cocktails) and were still so hungry we went to a sports bar to order burgers to eat. We sat outside, and we were able to order off of the menu from any of the three restaurants adjacent to each other (ABC Cocina, ABC Kitchen, ABCV) (they called in the Taste of ABC). We did like the Spring Pea Empanada. It was unique. I'd consider stopping by to order one of those as takeaway, but $15 for 2 (smallish) empanadas would give me pause.At the time, they had some lobster tacos on the menu. It was 2 tacos and literally had a small bit of lobster in each one. $20.Most of the food we ordered was...okay. Nothing was bad. I felt like a lot of things were a little bland, or just the sheer size of the tapas was shocking for the price.In contrast, we went to Boqueria on West 40th a couple weeks later; that place had better food, better portions, and better prices. We left there full! Skip ABC and go somewhere else for Tapas!"
Sin-Yaw W.,"San Jose, CA",1/3/2020,5 star rating,"We were going for a different place and found it closed for the date. Yelp came to the rescue to suggest this one.  What a save!First, this is not a cheap place.  Get your credit card ready.  Other than that, everything was excellent.  The pizza (mushroom and egg) was aromatic and baked just right.  They served it on an interesting ""wire cooler.""  The kale salad, topped with seared Salmon, was also just right.The sorbet, blood orange and kumquat, was so delicious!Lastly, the Manhattan was very well mixed.I highly recommend ordering to share."
Marci H.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",5/9/2021,5 star rating,Temperature screening when you enter. All servers masked and gloved. Social distance between dinners. The food as usual especially the Black Sea bass!
Jiawen W.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",12/25/2019,2 star rating,"Went to dinner with my boyfriend on Christmas Eve.  Overall experience was subpar especially considering they market it as a Jean George restaurant. We ordered tuna sashimi, arugula salad, wagu steak, black bass and chocolate cake.  The tuna sashimi didn't seem to be fresh and the sauce completely overwhelmed the dish.  The salad was extremely plain and lack flavor. The wagu steak was extremely disappointing as it was tasteless and dry. I totally don't understand their crispy black bass dish as it was bathed in water and vegetables which quickly made the fish soggy.  The chocolate cake tasted poorly as I had better from wholefood.  Not sure if it was because it was Christmas Eve, but the wait for each dish was incredible long...The solace to the experience was their cocktails which was pretty good.  Depending on where you sit the decor could also be underwhelming. I recommend if you plan to go, ask to sit in the inner part of the restaurant."
Callie E.,"New York, NY",2/23/2020,5 star rating,"Had a lovely lunch with colleagues on Valentine's Day. I had the 3 course price fixed meal with the cauliflower soup, salmon salad and because it was one of my colleagues birthdays and 3 of us got price fixed I got to try 3 desserts. We had the pistachio creme brûlée, salted caramel sundae with pop corn and the gingerbread cake with blood orange kumquat sorbet.Everything was wonderful and I thought the portion sizes especially for the salmon salad (which had more lettuce than I could eat normally) was very reasonable. The service was also great during the lunch rush. I look forward to coming again."
Rio S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",11/2/2021,5 star rating,The indoor ambience of this place feels so fresh and pristine. Yummiest drinks ever. Really sweet employees. Cool find
Peter S.,"Manhattan, NY",2/20/2022,1 star rating,"Sadly, ABC Kitchen after Covid has been such a disappointment. Turnover in staff has left the restaurant ill-equipped to manage high quality and knowledgeable waitstaff. When I dined there in August 2021, my appetizer  included seasonal melon which was rock hard and unripened. When I mentioned this to the waiter, he shrugged and did not know how to respond. Another waiter came by, and said that the melon was the best the chef had. I told the second waiter that the chef should not serve unripened melon, but I got just another shrug. It's sad when management doesn't care about providing the highest quality service of the highest quality food."
Linda W.,"New York, NY",1/28/2019,3 star rating,"Went for restaurant week last week. A little disappointing I'm not going to lie. Shaved raw fluke with apples and oranges was a complete miss, both taste and presentationThe entree was much better. Salmon on bob salad was cooked to perfection. And the fried chicken with spinach was good as well. They were gracious and just let us sit there for ages while we chatted, but I really was expecting more from the restaurant"
Inga S.,"New York, NY",1/31/2020,4 star rating,"We shower up without a reservation in Friday night and we got a table right away.Have been here many  timeS before andd alwAys loved the ambience and servIce so it was not different this time.We ordered squash ricotta toast which  was truly delicious.As a main course I tried sea bass with spinach and potatoes in a veggie broth which was a disappointment. Not bad  but tasted like a bland fish and veggie soup which was not worth 36$. Also had the mushroom pizza with egg which was delicious. Pistachio creme brule was the best part of the  meal, definitely worth trying.Sorry for  the quality of pics.. lighting was not the best."
Skip H.,"Avila Beach, CA",11/9/2021,4 star rating,Fresh ingredients with great combinations . Lovely organic setting with a discreet nod. Staff a little ridged for our liking but a must visit.
Sabrina A.,"Woodbury, NY",5/12/2021,5 star rating,10/10 no doubt. they combined all the restaurants due to covid so we tried one thing from each and just wow. I go to a lot of restaurants but there are so few i'd end up back at and this is one of them. top tier restaurant for sure.
Kate F.,"Fort Mitchell, KY",2/19/2019,4 star rating,"Mixed experience.  The hostess situation was bad - she checked us in and forgot we were there for over an hour (until I checked back in with her). Then seated us in the bar - which we specifically said not to.  The service- with Jesus as our main waiter- was very attentive.  The atmosphere is hip.Squash & ricotta app - surprisingly tasty!  My fav part of dinner.Calamari with pretzel app - good but not unique (tasted very typical of calamari).Bolognese pasta - good, though not sure I'd have again.  Spicy (which I like) but the spice took over the meaty flavor of the dish.  The pasta was done right.Sea bass - just not a fan.  Can't explain it, but was served in watery sauce with basil.  The basil overpowered.  The potatoes just didn't need to be there (lacked flavor). Disappointed.  Cookie appetizer - only liked the Malomar.  The rest was too sugary."
Sherry J.,"Miami, FL",4/10/2019,3 star rating,"What I love:- Bar area with beautiful sunlight coming through the windows- Two or three high top tables- The food actually tastes very good. I had the egg and fried oysters and I would definitely recommend it- The service was really goodProblems:- The interior is very dark, not the best when you come here on a sunny day- They keep people waiting at the front of the restaurant when they have a ton of empty tables around. (Are they not well staffed?)- My friend ordered the kale salad with salmon added on and it was basically a piece of salmon sitting on a plate full of kale. Not worth the $31. There are other restaurants out there that have food that tastes good but at a worthy price."
Ariel L.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",10/25/2021,5 star rating,"I've been coming here with my family for so many years now for birthday celebrations and other special occasions. Their food is incredible. It is expensive, but for a splurge every so often I couldn't recommend this place more. The service is wonderful, and you can tell there is a paced feel where you aren't rushed out. My good friend and I recently spent three hours there chatting and having dinner and they didn't bat an eye, which I really appreciate! Not sure why the average is only 4 stars, they deserve 5!"
Blue P.,"New York, NY",5/4/2022,1 star rating,"ABC Kitchen, you can do better with speaking to customers over the phone. Bad manner of talking, no professionalism, almost rude..."
Lenisha S.,"Brooklyn, NY",4/1/2021,4 star rating,"I was pleasantly surprised with this restaurant. I sat indoors and enjoyed a three course meal with wine amongst my husband and friends.The indoor experience didn't make me feel more or less ""protected."" They took our temperatures before we were seated, and all staff wore masks. The restaurant is big so tables were distanced and did not have any partitions. Our server was attentive, and knowledgeable about menu options which was helpful for someone at our table with a special diet. I had the crab toast, grass fed burger and fries, pistachio creme brûlée and moscato. I did have a hot tea but who really wants the review on a tea. Anywho, the crab toast was loaded with crab meat and had a fresh light flavor to it. My first bite into the burger was amazing! The combo of cheese salt pepper and jalapeño was delightful. It was a burst of flavor I did not expect. The pistachio creme brûlée was decent but nothing special. I think I could get these items somewhere else with either similar or greater flavor profiles. I'm not sure that I would return but I would recommend someone else give it a try."
Ashley H.,"Westminster, CA",10/24/2018,5 star rating,"We were recommended to this restaurant from a foodie friend, and it did not disappoint. Luckily, we were able to make a reservation a little less than a week in advance. Ambiance - (5/5) It's a beautiful and elegant restaurant. It is very dimly lit but a nice place to have a celebration (birthday, anniversary, etc.). The only thing is that it is pretty hard to read the menu in the dark. Service - (5/5) For a restaurant of this caliber, I expected great service and it deliver. I think that my water was refilled a total of 10 times throughout the entire meal. We were checked on constantly by the staff who were friendly and helpful. Food:Crab Toast with Lemon Aioli - (5/5) This was extremely tasty and loaded with shredded crab meat. The lemon aioli was the perfect touch of citrus and balanced the richness of the crab meat well.Shaved raw fluke, ocean herbs, and fermented green chili - (5/5) This was probably my favorite dish of the night. It was so light and refreshing yet each bite was an explosion of flavor. It was perfectly balanced with fresh herbs and the bits of fruit in the dish were delicious. It was sweet, salty, and sour in the perfect amounts. Line caught Tuna sashimi - (3.5/5) I don't personally like tuna very much. It was really good and like the other sushi dish, it was very refreshing but the flavors weren't as good as the fluke so I would choose that dish over this one. Black sea bass with chilies and herbs - (4/5) The sea bass was cooked perfectly, extremely fresh, and melted in your mouth. While the fish was delicious, the dish is essentially in a soup. I would have preferred the fish to be prepared differently. Sundae with Salted Caramel Ice Cream - (4.5/5) This was incredibly tasty and very salty (in a good way). It's not overly sweet but extremely tasty. The candied peanuts and popcorn were a perfect addition. The whipped cream and hot fudge was delicious. A perfect ending to the meal!"
Hannah M.,"Brooklyn, NY",8/18/2018,3 star rating,"Great, but overpriced. The JGV name carries a lot of weight, and in this city, that weight comes along with prices that are about 20% more than they should be. However, I found the value of this place and the quality of the food to be substantially better than the Latin sister ABC Cocina.Went with a large group and split a number of appetizers among the table. My favorites were the roasted beets with yogurt ($14) and the crab toast with lemon aioli ($16). The beets were absolutely phenomenal and the yogurt was unlike any I've had before. The missable dishes were the roast carrot and avocado salad ($17) and the summer squash and arugula salad ($16). Neither were bad, I just found them to be the least-exceptional and most-overpriced of the apps. The pretzel-dusted calamari ($18) was great, but no better than calamari I've had other places. I enjoyed all the appetizers and found, later, that they were the highlight of the meal. We each ordered our own main dish - typically I would have headed straight for the cheeseburger, but being that I was at a business dinner I opted for the cleaner and more sophisticated monkfish ($34), which was served alongside summer squash, tomatoes, and basil. I had only had monkfish once before when it was one of the choices for the catch of the day at Seamore's, but remembered liking it. I'm not sure if it was something in the fish itself or the flavoring, but I was unimpressed, both by the dish and the portion size. For dessert, we again passed around a number of dishes. The best, by far, were the blueberry pie with goat milk ice cream and lavender ($13) and the peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream ($12). The almond cake and chocolate cake (the latter especially) were remarkably dry and bland. The interior is awesome and clearly adorned with pieces from ABC Carpet & Home. Service was professional but not stiff. All in all, I've found the JGV's restaurants excel with fruits and veggies but have yet to master meats/fishes/etc. Will try abcV at some point to test my logic."
Daggie C.,"Las Vegas, NV",10/25/2021,5 star rating,The food and service was great! My truffle pizza with an egg was so good I got it twice. Not to mention their red bell pepper martini! So delicious. Didn't take a lot of pictures because we were hungry when we got there and forgot but we got the crab toast and my husband a pasta dish that was really good too. I can't wait to be back in NY and eat in this place again.
Shirin P.,"Houston, TX",3/3/2020,4 star rating,"Good service and good food. Portions are small and prices are big, but it's New York and Jean Georges restaurant so it's to be expected. We only ordered two meals, strozzapreti with spicy bolognese and potato mushroom (and what I think may have. We beet) pizza. Both very delicious. We will be going back to try other items on the menu. Dining room is large and your are NOT sitting on top of other patrons which is a big plus."
Mike D.,"Carle Place, NY",4/23/2022,5 star rating,"Amazing food, great ambiance, and helpful staff. The ricotta toast is one of my favorite dishes. There are three ABC restaurants, I'd recommend trying each one as they all have a different vibe and different menus, drinks, etc."
Johanna B.,"Brooklyn, NY",9/13/2019,3 star rating,"3.5 stars. Randomly walked in without a reservation and that only meant one thing---seating at the bar since the next available table would be at 10 p.m. Bar seating it was.ABC earns 5+ stars for the ambiance and its  elegance. I'm not sure how large the dining area was, but this place was jam packed all through the night. We were fortunate to grab a  couple available seats at the bar. Service was good and attentive as far as the drinks.I wanted to start with wine but was undecided (what else is new) whether to select Reisling,  Rose or the Sancerre (all were bartender's recommendation). The bartender laid out 3 glasses and allowed me to try a sample of  all 3. I ultimately decided on the dry Reisling. Very delicious. At the same time, some creative cocktails were being made and looked quite good.For main, I selected the Campanelle pasta with spicy tomato (didn't detect any spice) with eggplant (very few pieces) and  ricotta (just a dollop). Although the dish was flavorful and tasty, it didn't exactly wow me. The other main ordered was really an appetizer of Summer Squash and Arugula Salad and the opinion was average. Food took a while to come out to us.I would need to return and try more food from the menu to better assess my opinion of ABC. The atmosphere was definitely elegant and inviting. It seemed everyone wanted to be there.I would return."
Racheallee L.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2/4/2020,5 star rating,"Ok, it's may be restaurant week but for a late lunch, I had to try a few items. Mostly were the apps, and not big meals butt the couple next to me raved about their salmon and chicken entree. I had the Fluke and Tuna sashimi (separate dishes) and the cauliflower soup. OMG. Amazing. Also had a fantastic glass of crisp white Grenache from Italy. Very amazing...Can't wait tto go grackles and try other menu items. Oh, and their deserts looked incredible. Didn't have any today, but next time, I'm all in."
Anam Q.,"Toronto, Canada",12/5/2019,4 star rating,"Heard so many people recommend this place for our visit to NYC, so I booked a reservation to celebrate my husband's birthday. As soon as we entered, I was in awe of the beautiful dining room and ambiance. We got there right at 8, but still had to wait about 15-20 minutes for our table. I got the thyme lemonade to start with and it was delicious. After reading a lot of great reviews, we ordered the crab toast with lemon aioli, which I loved. It was very flavorful, I just wish the toast was a bit softer but otherwise it was good. I got the fettuccine with basil pesto and my husband got the organic chicken with spicy butter. Both dishes were pretty good, but not amazing. I would say you're paying more for the ambiance than anything, like the food was good but it was nothing spectacular. Either way, it's a great place to go out for a special occasion."
Ritzelle F.,"Rego Park, NY",10/12/2019,5 star rating,"Impressive and actually worth it! Came here on a Wednesday night to celebrate my birthday. We arrived an hour early for our reservation and lucky for us was seated  earlier! The ambiance of the restaurant is romantic, relaxed and comfortable. The decor matches with the theme and the vibe of the restaurant.We were ushered in by the maitre d' to our table. The table setting were simple but well thought of, with a single flower on a vase and some candles. The waiter then came and introduced himself, very nice, and accommodating. Explains the menu. I ordered a cocktail and my friend ordered a glass of red wine. As appetizers, we ordered the cheese plate and the tuna sashimi. Our entree is the hake dish and the butterflied porkchops. All the dishes were amazing, flavored and cooked to perfection . We ended our meal with the ricotta cheesecake and coffee. Plus, they surprised me with the tiny cupcake in a plate with a birthday greeting! A great place to enjoy food and the noise level is acceptable that you could have a great conversation with your dinner date!"
Bianca F.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",11/17/2019,4 star rating,"I've wanted to come to ABC Kitchen for over two years. A fan favourite and recommendation amongst many of my friends, I knew I had to come here and let me tell you, it exceeded my expectations on all fronts.From booking my reservation to the dining in, the service was outstanding. Our servers were so wonderful, constantly checking in and so willing to provide recommendations for nearby cocktail bars for our NYC visit.I went for dinner with a friend on a Monday night and it was a FULL house. The ambience in there is like no other, the candles, the dim lights -- I loved everything about it!We ordered a delicious pesto pasta with roasted brussel sprouts, which was amazing. The portions were good and the pesto was fresh -- you could taste it. We also ordered the wagyu steak entree, which was delicious as well. The steak was cooked a little bit more charred, but it was delicious nonetheless and accompanied by greens and a potato latke-like crunch side...which were also yummy! Our salad stood out the most -- we ordered a roasted carrot and avocado salad. Not sure what the dressing was, but I could have eaten two more plates of it! For dessert, we ordered a chocolate cake-type thing. Nothing to phone home about, but it was good! Charmed the sweet tooth with beautiful presentation.I would 100% return to ABC Kitchen -- it was the perfect NYC dining experience. If you're not a local, I would highly recommend booking 30 days in advance to secure a good reservation."
Sujoyee C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",9/23/2020,5 star rating,ABC kitchen is one of my favorite dinner spots in town and continues to be! Their lobster is to die for.
Nini N.,"Lombard, IL",3/7/2021,5 star rating,The ambiance was so nice and the food was just amazing. Our waiter was very kind and thoughtful. I highly recommend going here!
Wenye X.,"New York, NY",7/4/2018,4 star rating,"Finally! I have always wanted to come here, but it is pretty hard to get a reservation here on weekend. I got the famous crab toast and the roasted carrot salad. My boyfriend got a pasta entree. The crab toast is bomb! There is so much crab meat on the toast, and toast is well toasted. The overall taste is so refreshing! I do wish the portion is a bit bigger though. The salad is also amazing: the roasted carrots are sweet and the dressing is also spot on! Definitely one of my favorite salads in nyc. My boyfriend loved his pasta a lot, but I find it a bit too spicy and cheesy. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and is quite spacious. It is good for a healthy yummy meal. Will come back!"
Sody G.,"New York, NY",1/7/2021,5 star rating,I ate inside when we were still able too but you can also sit outside. The crab toast is Devine as well as the sandwiches. Fries are fabulous. I got latte and mimosa
Melanie R.,"New York, NY",8/15/2019,3 star rating,"I was really looking forward to return after my last experience here. My friends and I made reservations for brunch. When we arrived, it was quite busy. Service was still top notch. Unfortunately, the food was not as good as I remembered.- Calamari: Skip. The pretzel breading was way too heavy and extremely salty. The spicy tomato and mustard aioli sauces were also very salty. - Crab Toast: Still my favorite dish! Although it's an appetizer meant for sharing, I was very satisfied just having it as my main. There was plenty of crab on thin sliced toasted bread. The touch of lemon aioli was delicious. - Mushroom Pizza: AVOID. It was overpriced and a huge disappointment. The ingredients lacked flavor. The center of the pizza was watery and it completely fell apart when you tried to pick up. I also had a campari daiquiri which was fantastic. It was not too sweet, tart with a bitter finish. My friend liked her rhuharb lavender fizz cocktail too. I don't recommend coming here for brunch. I feel that it's more of a dinner place."
Rebecca D.,"New York, NY",7/9/2018,4 star rating,"This place was so cute! I love the atmosphere and the place settings. I love the decor, and that they have the fresh vegetables out and you can see them. Our table unanimously decided that this place was ""shabby chic.""We could only get a reservation for 6 people at 5:30pm. I called in advance the same day to see if we could get a later reservation and they told us we could come at 6 but we had to leave by 8 for the next table. I appreciated that they let us come a little later. One of our guests was not able to make it which we let them know when we revised the time of the reservation.When we did finally get there, it upset me that with a larger table of 5 that they wouldn't let us sit till the whole party was there. Who else are you going to give this table to? They also told us on the phone we had to be out by 8 for the next reservation at that table and we wanted to get started! But to no avail.  I would like to note that my table did have a weird request for the food (switching a sauce on a pasta dish) to which the kitchen graciously obliged. We really appreciated that they were willing to do this for us.Regarding service:Overall I was surprised at how slow the service was, and how infrequently we saw our server. I asked the guy that brought out our food for a few things a few times, but he had to send the waiter over. Also, after our appetizers, we had to wait a really long time for our main courses.  Regarding the food:roast carrot and avocado salad, crunchy seeds, creme fraiche and citrus 17 - amazing. Perfect avocado. kale salad with lemon, serrano chilies and mint $17 - it was just a kale salad ‍Fluke crudo - was light and bright - good flavors and texture. Really enjoyed it. Pea soup - it was a lot thinner than I was expecting and was served warm. Was almost like a pea broth. I would have preferred it thicker. Pasta with peas, pesto, parmesan - was good. Ravioli- the guests at my table wanted the ravioli with the pesto sauce instead of the red sauce. They were kind enough to accommodate for us. It was actually really good with the substitution. Chocolate cake - melted chocolate ganache and toasted marshmallow icing. It was okay. The icing was more marshmallow than icing. I couldn't taste the malt at all. Overall a solid meal. I would come back.  The decor was my favorite."
Jaimee A.,"Manhattan, NY",2/20/2018,2 star rating,"This restaurant needs a serious menu change!We have been here multiple times and this time it didn't thrill. The service was friendly and the space was beautiful but the food..... Meh.We had:- Crab Toast with Lemon Aioli - Good.  When we initially saw this, we were surprised it was still on the menu after all this time, after the rest of the meal we were glad it was there.- Cured Meats and Local Cheese - Meats were good, cheeses were so so. One of them was so ammoniated that I mentioned it to the waitress. She said the chef told her ""it was supposed to be."" Seriously? We have eaten at Artisanal and Picholine, places with amazing cheese courses. Ammoniated is not something you strive for. It means the cheese has sat too long and is past its prime.- Roasted Beets with Yogurt - Tasty- Mushroom, Parmesan, Oregano and Farm Egg Pizza - Yuck! We have had it before and it was very good. This time it was ridiculously loaded with what tasted like boiled mushrooms. Last time, it had a good amount of mushrooms, but this was insane. There was no parmesan and very little egg. It tasted like boiled mushrooms. - Roasted Acorn Squash - Could have been good, but every third mouthful had a very strong spice that burned our mouths.- Almond Cake - Good but basic.This was a disappointing dining experience and I don't think we will be back."
Olivia G.,"New York, NY",8/15/2020,2 star rating,"I feel bad posting this because I understand the strain covid has put on the dining industry - but I don't want others to come here and waste money.  Do NOT go here post/during COVID. We loved ABC prior to covid but is sadly not the same now. We received terrible service, the outdoor area was incredibly non pleasing and the food was just not good. The chips and salsa looked like we just bought it from Trader Joe's. Food was not fresh, pretty sure the corn was from a can. Extremely limited menu which is understandable during COVID but still things ran out. We were never offered drink refills and had empty water with no napkins or silverware  for 20+ minutes. Especially at the unreasonably high price point- total disappointment. Will not be returning probably ever"
Rebecca B.,"Montclair, NJ",3/22/2022,5 star rating,"Jean George still got it!!! Service was great, atmosphere is beautiful and the food is still consistently amazing.  The truffle pizza, caramel popcorn sundae, and cavatelli with duck ragu were the standout's for me."
Maria O.,"Miami, FL",11/21/2020,2 star rating,"VERY BAD SERVICE! We used to like this place before the pandemic, gave it a try today and we had to leave before even ordering, unfortunately they have a waitress with a pretty bad attitude, who was annoyed by questions we asked and directed us to the menu, then left us waiting for a very long time to take our order until we decided to leave without eating there.During this pandemic, all places are really working hard to provide outstanding service, it is very sad that this restaurant is not doing the same and losing clients..."
Matt M.,"Brooklyn, NY",10/14/2018,4 star rating,"What can I possibly write that hasn't already been written about this NYC institution?!  ABC Kitchen captures what hospitality is all about:  warm, attentive, and generous service; great food; and a terrific ambiance.  The space itself is absolutely breathtaking.We dined at ABC for Saturday brunch.   My girlfriend was a bit indecisive in her choice of wine and our friendly and knowledgeable waiter was able to guide us through their wine menu.  He even offered a tasting prior to making a selection!  I decided to be boring and ordered a cup of coffee - one of the best cups of coffee I've had in the city.For starters, we shared the Crab Toast with Lemon Aoli.  The crab was fresh, delicious, and well dressed (solid portion size too).  Definitely the highlight of our meal.  For mains, we ordered the Eggs Benedict with Flying Pigs Farm Ham and the Cabbage and Apple Salad.  The Eggs Benedict was amazing.  The yolk was perfectly runny, the muffin was homemade, and the chef piled on a heaping serving of some damn good ham.  Unfortunately, the salad fell short.  The dish was too acidic owing to the vinegar and the cashew yogurt didn't really pop.  Perhaps poor dish selection.  If it weren't for the salad mishap I would have rated this place five stars."
Lynn O.,"Manhattan, NY",7/25/2020,2 star rating,"Tonight's dinner was a disappointment.  We made the reservation a few weeks ago in order to celebrate a birthday; we understood that the seating would be outdoors due to covid, and the 3 ABC restaurants were  combining space to do so, with one menu.  We were seated under a scaffolding, with the loud air-conditioning for the kitchen right above us, and the smells from the pizza oven blowing on us.  There were no pretty plants, flowers, candles, lights, or anything else to try to make the place look attractive.  We were all stunned; such a lovely restaurant and it looked so drab, not like so many of the lesser quality restaurants and bars in town.  We ordered our drinks, a guacamole appetizer and 4 entrees (arroz y pollo, 2 individual pizzas and 1 roasted cauliflower).  The guacamole came at the same time as the chicken dish.  The cauliflower came a few minutes later.  The 2 pizzas came about 10 minutes later.  What kind of serving is that?  2 of us sat and stared at our meals, waiting for our friends to be served before we could eat.  A good restaurant serves people at the same time, and lets people enjoy their appetizer first.  We were never asked if we would like another round of drinks. The guacamole was good. The chicken was good. The cauliflower was delicious. The truffles pizza was good. The spinach pizza was too salty. The vegan chocolate dessert we requested, with a birthday candle, was good. The waiter, William B,  was very nice and he tried. A disappointing birthday dinner.  We enjoyed ourselves because we enjoy each other's company, but the lack of ambiance and the uneven service put a damper on a special night."
Hannah J.,"SUNNYSIDE, NY",9/20/2019,5 star rating,"Beautiful decor inside!Went for lunch and although we did make a reservation, didn't seem too packed.We started with the crab toast and tomato salad - both very light, fresh and great for sharing. For my main entree, I went for the burger and it was HEAVENLY. Loved that it had a bit of a spicy kick to it. Highly recommended!"
Dennis K.,"Philadelphia, PA",9/11/2019,5 star rating,"Must get the Crab Toast with lemon aioli....best thing I've had in a long time.Good crab portion, bread is toasted well that isn't burnt, with the hint of taste of the lemon aioli is unforgettable.Roasted carrot and avocado salad, crunchy seed, sour cream and citrus - was decent.  The croutons were the most memorable from this dish.  Probably the best croutons I've ever had."

I loved the decor with the exposed wood ceiling and the light, open feeling. Service is great too. I had the tuna sashimi appetizer and while the portion is small, the flavor is great! Eggs Benedict with salmon: so so good! The portion was generous for me. There were also potatoes which were good. Freshly squeezed OJ: very good and fresh! Yay! I would certainly come back!"
Nina W.,"San Francisco, CA",8/20/2021,5 star rating,"So good, in an exhilarating way. Everything is so fresh and so full of flavor. Whether in person or through delivery, the food here has always been outstanding.The Carrot and Avocado Salad is shockingly addictive. Recently, I was wary of getting the Lobster (because it is only lobster), but oh my gosh, it was amazing-- tender, juicy, flavorful. Actually, same for all of the seafood dishes that I've tried here. And getting dessert is always a good idea."
Neelum K.,"Jersey City, NJ",6/24/2019,4 star rating,"This is an awesome place to go with a group.  The service is so generous - they give you all the time you desire and come only when you need them.  I like that!  We were here for 3 hours on a Saturday (you must make a reservation or this is not an option), and tried many items ""family style"".  I LOVED the squash blossom pizza!  OMG I will come back just for that and NOT share it with anyone!  Burger was good, meat and cheese platter was also good.  What is GREAT are the drinks.  I have a feeling everything on the menu here is pretty amazing.  Also, the Union Square farmers market is right there, so its a nice way to spend a Saturday in the city."
Neerali T.,"New York, NY",11/7/2019,5 star rating,"We were looking for a nice quiet dinner at an upscale restaurant and decided to head to ABC Kitchen . Make sure to make a reservation beforehand. This restaurant is generally fully booked. What I like about this restaurant is the nice and casual approach. At most Michelin star restaurants you see people really dressed up. Here, everyone is dressed comfortably and seen enjoying themselves. While making a reservation, we had informed them that it is my husbands birthday. They gave us a complimentary cupcake for the same! I would like to give a shout out to the staff, extremely courteous and the service super prompt. What we ordered:BRUT CHAMPAGNE: The classic celebratory champagneFETTUCCINI WITH PESTO, PISTACHIO AND BRUSSEL SPROUTS:Definitely the best pesto fettuccini I have had in a very long time. The pesto is rich, nice and creamy. The pasta is topped with abundant parmesan shavings. The brussels sprouts are extremely small and deep fried. I was apprehensive of my pasta containing brussel sprouts but it was a fine surprise. THIS IS A MUST ORDER. WHOLE WHEAT PIZZA(SPINACH, GOAT CHEESE AND HERBS):The pizza crust looks fluffy and thick but this pizza is super light. It is neither a thin crust pizza nor a thick crust pizza. You can taste the goat cheese and spinach in every bite. I would have liked if the herbs were more but I'm not complaining of this pizza!CHOCOLATE PUDDING: We were recommended their classic sundae but we went forward with th e chocolate pudding. The chocolate pudding comes with a glazed layer of marshmallow and loaded with chocolate balls. You have to be a complete chocolate lover to enjoy this dessert. Mu husband and I are chocolate lovers and we enjoyed this dessert. The marshmallow layer is so thin you can barely taste it. The chocolate balls literally melt the second you place them in your mouth."
Sonia H.,"Bayside, Queens, NY",8/2/2019,4 star rating,"Rustic, but chic. Dim, but airy. ABC Kitchen has lights fixated on each table, effectively dimming out everything beyond the tables. This creates a very natural, intimate atmosphere, perfect for dates or small group dinners. The noise level definitely got louder through dinner, but it was tolerable. The service was wonderful. The hostess was accommodating, allowing us to be seated prior to our reservation time (most tables were empty) because the bar area was full. Our waitress suggested and offered us to wine tasting before we committed to a bottle. My two friends and I ordered in family style:1. housemade ricotta with strawberry compote and grilled bread (delicious, would recommend)2. mushrooms, parmesan, oregano, farm egg whole wheat pizza (delicious, would recommend if you like mushroom, but did get soggy quickly)3. summer squash and arugula salad with pecorino shavings (okay, not memorable)4. campanelle w spicy sungold tomato sauce, eggplant, and fresh ricotta (okay, not memorable)With a bottle of riesling, weinhof scheu 'schweigener' troken 2016, pfalz, Germany (would recommend)While the atmosphere and service were impeccable, the menu was a hit or miss. I do wish to give ABC Kitchen another chance in the far future."
Lianna T.,"New York, NY",10/5/2018,3 star rating,"I made a reservation weeks in advance to celebrate my mother's birthday at ABC Kitchen (her choice) and am so disappointed that the restaurant did not live up to our expectations. We had been years ago for lunch and had so enjoyed the atmosphere. The restaurant is set inside the store and has beautifully mismatched plates and an overall modern but chic decor. The atmosphere was still lovely, but the chaos, noisy-ness, and slow service made for an overall unenjoyable dinner. When I called, I had informed them it was my mother's birthday and was so pleased that they said they could bring out a birthday cupcake and candle at the end of the meal. However, we were seated at a table in the middle of the dining room - and it was so loud we could barely hear each other even when shouting. We ordered the new-to-the- menu cabbage and apple salad with apple cider vinegar and walnut dressing and the sea bass entree to split. The salad was okay - an interesting combination of flavors, but something I felt could be recreated in a home kitchen and with a more sizable portion. The sea bass was quite good as the fish tasted fresh, flaky and flavorful. While the meal was okay - waiting for our orders to be taken, the food to come, and then the plates to be cleared was frustratingly slow. The restaurant was filled with waiters, but getting the attention of any one felt impossible. By the time we finished our courses, spent ten minutes trying to get our plates cleared, another ten trying to get the dessert menu, and another ten trying to place our order, my mother decided she would enjoy a dessert in a calmer, less chaotic environment. The birthday cupcake never came and we left the restaurant feeling frustrated and with slight headaches. Overall, the food was good, but honestly not worth the largely disorienting, loud, and frustrating experience that was supposed to be a calm and happy celebration."
Jessica K.,"Dallas, TX",11/9/2019,5 star rating,"Went here for brunch with a friend while in New York and overall, it was a lovely experience! Upon walking in, the decor is captivating and welcoming. There are beautiful antique chandeliers and wall fixtures that give it a very artsy vibe. Our waiter was attentive, but not pushy. I ordered the goat cheese and spinach omelette and my friend got the shrimp salad. Our waiter also brought out a complimentary toast with crab on it, which was delicious. At the end of our meal, we asked the host to take photos of us with the decor and he was very obliging and sweet about it."
Anitha K.,"Manhattan, NY",12/6/2017,4 star rating,"I LOVE the decor at this place. Rustic & Elegant. Not surprising since I'm sure it's all from ABC home. We really enjoyed all the dishes here. Very simple flavors and you don't feel overly stuffed after your meal. It's nice to see a high end restaurant with a lighter fare. We tried the Black sea bass, salmon and pork dishes. All awesome. The Beet Salad was also good but pricey for what it was. Ended the meal with a Rhubarb and strawberry pie that was amazing! Need to come back to try the crab toast and everything else. Make a reservation in advance! super popular so I'd recommend planning a month beforei"
Lauren G.,"Bridgewater, NJ",6/3/2019,5 star rating,"When you walk in it's super romantic - very cabin chic. The smells reminds me of an older fireplace but is so comforting. My one dislike was when we were seated behind us was a store! I'm not sure what storeOpens up into this restaurant but it's a weird design and kind of ruins the romance of it all. What are you going toDo! Space is limited in Manhattan. My cucumber martini was very good. Portion size for appetizers varies but is smaller. We opted to share a bunch of apps instead of ordering meals. Calamari was good, housemade ricotta was phenomenal and the bread was super good and fresh. We ordered the tuna as well which was so fresh! So another disappointment for me was the side of the crab toast- it was one piece of bread cut into 4 pieces. The flavors were on point but it was sooo small! ThisPlace is not cheap by any means but really enjoyed my night here"
Diana N.,"Oceanside, CA",7/26/2021,2 star rating,"We went to ABC kitchen for my boyfriend's birthday and had a reservation. The atmosphere and place was overall nice. However, the only downside was that our food took a long time and we noticed those around us that got seated later and ordered later, receive their entrees before us. It was overall crowded and busy, so I think the experience could have been better if the staff was more attentive and the food didn't take an hour to get to our table."
Mike B.,"Washington, DC",2/24/2018,5 star rating,"We finally fulfilled a longtime ambition when we sauntered through the door of ABC kitchen. We enjoyed the ricotta with pear and grilled bread appetizer.  The rich, creamy cheese paired well with the sweet, but slightly tangy fruit.We split the fettuccine and pistachio pesto as a first course. This dish combined fresh pasta with tasty nuts. I highly recommend it. For my main, I went with the pork confit accompanied by bacon. It was pure porcine perfection! The confit preparation results in tender,  moist pork, a meat which in lesser restaurants can be in danger of tasting dry."
Molly T.,"New York, NY",10/3/2017,4 star rating,"Even non-foodies know about ABC Kitchen. The ABC enterprise is a total juggernaut in the city. Whether you're lusting after Tibetan art at ABC Carpet & Home or drooling over clean, organic eats at any of the ABC restaurants, you're probably swooning over something here. The sheer number of reviews for ABC Kitchen almost makes me want to save my energy because I'm guessing that most things one could say about this place have already been documented here. But as evidence by that painful run-on sentence, I'm going to take a stab at writing ABC Kitchen up, too. It was a long-awaited trip and the food was delightful. It didn't wow me in the way that I was expected to be wowed, but my expectations were comically high. So considering that, I'm satisfied. We came here at around 8:30 on a Saturday night. And yes, for a primetime reservation like that, you'll need to book pretty far out. It's worth it, just to get the full ambiance of this place. I had already been to ABCv before dining at ABC Kitchen so was already familiar with the general aesthetic at all things ABC, but this was still a treat. Simultaneously trendy, warm, natural/earthy, elegant. Take a lap if you can while you're waiting for your noms to arrive. In addition to a superb wine list, ABC Kitchen has a good selection of cocktails. I get giddy ordering cocktails at the Jean-Georges establishments because I feel like the relative healthfulness of the drinks cancel out the fact that I'm drinking poison. There are always some fruit and veggie components, which is not the norm of mixed drinks. Nowadays I mostly drink wine (I ordered wine with dinner ultimately), but I made an exception for Carrotini here. Vodka-based, carrot, ginger, lime. I'm a health nut and this felt like a proper Juice Press shot--making me twice as happy because it also helped with the whole inebriation thing. The drinking experience was slightly tainted, though. The cocktail took about 30 minutes to arrive. The bartender did pour it in front of us which was a nice touch, but the flair was lost on me given how impatient I had become at that point. My glass of wine ""with dinner"" also didn't pan out so well. Our waiter was emphatic that the Sancerre would pair well with one of our mains (the bass--more on that in a moment), which I factored into my decision-making process. Unfortunately, the wine didn't arrive until long after we were served said main. It was tasty, but tardy. The food here is as advertised. Fresh and organic, clean flavors, healthy and interesting. Nothing wildly creative but all well-executed. We ended up splitting one of the smaller bites, one appetizer and two mains. It was just barely enough food--I was expecting the mains to be bigger, so we could've managed with one more app. Can't have too much FOMO, though. Our eats, below:  Crab toast with lemon aioli: AThe famous crab toast! I was expecting to have my world rocked, and that didn't quite happen. But man, this was still so very good. That lemon aioli on top was key. And as is usually the case with powerhouse toast appetizers (I've had many), I was very sad when it was over. I'll just order 4-6 of these and call it a meal. Roast carrot and avocado salad, crunchy seeds, sour cream and citrus: AThis is the first week it's really been feeling like fall, and this felt like a great transition. Summery with the avo, autumn-y with the carrot. Simply roasted, very warming. Liked the pepitas on top--added some lovely texture. Would've liked a tad more sour cream, but that's just me being nit-picky. Black sea bass with chilies and herbs, baby market potatoes and spinach: AFresh and delicious. Nothing particularly notable but I love sea bass so I was happy with a perfectly-cooked piece of fish atop some yummy spinach. Crispy pork confit, smoked bacon marmalade and braised turnips: A/A+This dish was a lot smaller than expected (they advertised it as being a sizable plate) but otherwise, a sublime combo of ingredients--very well thought-out. The smoke bacon marmalade was pure crap and the greens underneath were super flavorful and held the sauce nicely. I very rarely eat mashed potatoes (I know I know, so sue me) but these were a worthy addition as well. Creamy and rich. Definitely our most decadent dish of the night, but not uncomfortably heavy."

Ira D.,"Woodridge, IL",7/25/2021,5 star rating,Came back after being here years ago. It was a great atmosphere and meal. Service was as expected. They even sat us earlier than our reservation time...which helped us.
S M.,"Pompano Beach, FL",8/4/2019,5 star rating,"My daughter has been insisting (since they've opened) that I dine here. I finally did!It was by far, the best meal I have had in a very long time.Everything from the moment we were seated until the moment we left was excellent. Ambiance, hostesses, servers, presentation of each dish, and distinct flavors were all perfect.We shared many dishes, ( appetizers) which were all so delicious! I ordered the chicken for dinner which was outstanding!I highly recommend this restaurant for a wonderful dining experience!Thank you to my daughter."
Victor D.,"Seattle, WA",6/2/2018,2 star rating,"Wow I came here hearing that it's really hard to get reservations and I managed to get one! Imagine how excited I am to try it.We got the crab toast, fried chicken, and crispy pork confit, and fettuccine.The crab toast, like all others have said, is the best item and you have to get it. It's basically some buttered crab on some well toasted bread. I don't think it's particularly hard to make...but it is very tasty.The fried chicken, now that was very interesting. The fried chicken itself sits on some spinach and spicy sauce, so it reminds you of southern fried chicken. What's so unique about this chicken is that it's a large piece that has no bones! How is that possible?? Well they stitch together  chicken breast and thigh to make this possible. So some part of the chicken will be more dry than the others. As for the battering, it's a very light batter. I thought this was an interesting dish, but I didn't think it was particularly good.... Note, if you are sharing this dish make sure you don't just get caught with the red meat or white meat as that makes the experience very different :DThe pork confit wasn't that special either. There are two different kinds of pork. One is the main dish, a bit on the dry side. That's probably why there's mashed potatoes around it. Then there's a more saucy/asiany style pork belly. That is very firm and also very dry. Not that great....The fettecuni was really good. I lied, this is probably my favorite dish from the meal. The pasta itself was so good, it's firm and strong and it feels so fresh. There are a lot of fresh ingredients like the pesto, peas, and other veggies.  Overall this place was a huge disappointment given how good it was supposed to be. Wouldn't recommend spending a decent amount of money here."
Patrick N.,"Brooklyn, NY",8/10/2017,2 star rating,"I really wanted to love this place. It has a hipster decor with all the servers wearing plaids. I never had a disappointed experience from JG restaurants. I came here for RW lunch. I ordered from RW menu, but my date ordered a black bass entree from the regular menu. raw fluke for appetizers: this was OK. The aesthetic of this dish was dull and unimpressive. It's simply white on a plate that looked like a paper plate. Taste-wise, it was ok. The horseradish with the fish tasted a bit like eating sushi but with an extra punch.portobello burger for entree: the first bite was delicious. The portobello was juicy and the sauce was awesome. The inner part was extremely SALTY to the extreme that it was bitter. Black bass (non-RW): the black bass had crispy skin but the spinach was inedible. It was so salty that we had to send it back. Worse yet, the new fish she got was significantly smaller than the initial one. The sundae with caramel ice cream was delicious, but they overdid it with too much fudge. It was way too sweet as you scoop to the bottom of the sundae.  Tl;Dr food was salty and they screwed up on the details. I am especially harsh on this restaurant considering its reputation. The service was subpar considering they weren't especially packed for RW lunch and the screwed-up dish wasn't even from the RW menu!"
Olivia C.,"Montvale, NJ",6/23/2021,4 star rating,"I had high expectations coming here after an amazing meal at ABC Cocina, and it did not disappoint! The service was very friendly, but didn't really standout to me. Although inside the restaurant is was quite dark for my liking, the food made up for it! My sister ordered the lobster, and it was literally just lobster with nothing accompanying so she was still hungry and had some of my black truffle and fontina whole wheat pizza (which was so. good.), so if you get the lobster, I do recommend ordering a side/small app. The menu is fairly limited as well."
Shelbi C.,"Louisville, KY",2/14/2020,5 star rating,"It could be raining outside (it was) but you would never know it inside ABC. The space is so light and airy with clean lines and floral details. We dined here for lunch, the perfect spot for a meal after a runway show. We arrived earlier than our reservation but the hostess was able to quickly accommodate us. I ordered a greens juice to get me started. There was an enticing lunch three course prix-fixe menu that in the end, convinced  us all. First course was a warm and creamy cauliflower soup that had just the right amount of spice from the chili. Main course was a delicious pan seared salmon over a bed of fresh greens. ABC definitely saved the best for last with a pistacho creme brûléed to perfection. As much as the other two were satisfying, this was probably my favorite. Nothing was left in my bowl. After you dine here, I suggest you wander around ABC carpet and home if you are looking for any gifts or just some home decor inspiration."
Chris B.,"New York, NY",3/17/2019,5 star rating,"Love ABC Kitchen! About as good as it gets in this price range for restaurant choices in Manhattan. Perfect place to take a date, huge restaurant with great ambiance, all the items on the menu are unique. Also a good place to take visitors to NYC.The entrance from the street is a little confusing, it's hard to tell which of the three ABC restaurants you are walking into. Service was top notch, and food was delicious. We ordered:crab toast with lemon aioli ($18) - this was so good I forgot to take a picture. It looks like all the other reviews. Must order!shaved raw fluke, apples, horseradish, blood oranges ($19) - creative unique, appetizer. Very delicious and not too unhealthy.faroe island salmon in mushroom crust, lemon emulsion, herbs ($36) - my girlfriend ordered this, she liked it.grilled pork chop, frill mustard with apple mostarda ($37) - I ordered the pork chop and I'm glad I did! The sauce was delicious. Recommendedshaved brussels sprouts slaw, mustard vinaigrette, cranberries, chives ($10) - I've never heard of brussel sprouts slaw before, but this was creative and good. Sorbet for dessert was very good. Overall great experience and will definitely be back. Highly recommended!"
Tiffanii C.,"New York, NY",4/7/2019,5 star rating,"Came here with a friend who was visiting the city for Sunday brunch. We made sure to book a reservation ahead of time as I heard about the super long waiting times on Yelp. Nonetheless, we had to wait about 10 minutes or so as our table wasn't ready yet, which wasn't a problem.We got a variety of dishes: Buttermilk and Crawford Cheddar biscuits, Crab Toast with Lemon Aioli, Smoked Salmon with Horseradish, Creme Fraiche and Lemon, and Eggs Benedict with Flying Pigs Farm Ham. I loved each single dish we had (minus the Smoked Salmon as I don't like Smoked Salmon but my friend absolutely loved it!)! The biscuits were buttery, flaky-ish, and overall indulgent in taste and texture. I personally preferred it without the butter but my friend loved it with the addition of butter so definitely try that. You could also really taste the cheddar and overall, it was just an amazing assortment of flavors. I saw that the Crab Toast with Lemon Aioli was a big hit on Yelp and the reviews were right on point! The crab chunks were beautifully fresh, moist (sorry but true), soft, and delicious. The lemon juice added a wonderful tang to the dish as well as the lemon aioli. The buttery toast also gave such a nice crunch and flavor. I highly recommend getting this!The Eggs Benedict was also a wonderful dish. The saltiness of the ham paired with the mildly seasoned egg really went well together. The eggs were perfectly cooked with a beautifully runny yolk. The hollandaise sauce was also really silky and creamy and made the overall dish a flavor bomb. The diced potatoes were also nicely flavored, so I give this dish a huge thumbs up as well!Overall, this is a nice place to dine with visiting friends, relatives, or even with a date hehe. It's not the cheapest restaurant, but the price is worth it in my opinion."

Benson Y.,"New York, NY",2/25/2019,4 star rating,"ABC Kitchen is associated with the nearby ABC Carpet and Home.  Known for its cross between modern and classic design sensibilities, its wares are not cheap but they are whimsical and lovely to look at.  However if you ever wanted to have a meal inside the interior of ABC Carpet and Home, ABC Kitchen gives you that chance ! Walking into the restaurant feels like you have walked into a catalog complete with beautiful lighting, furniture and fixtures.  It is an absolutely gorgeous space with a modern, semi-rustic design.I came for a birthday brunch, so I was able to try several dishes.  Here is a rundown:CRAB TOAST WITH LEMON AIOLIThese small pieces of toast each came with a delicious crab salad.  The texture and flavor were both nice and smooth while the aioli gave it a bright ""bite"" of flavor.  Definitely get these!MUSHROOMS, PARMESAN, OREGANO & FARM EGG PIZZAThis small pizza is perfect for 3-4 people to share.  The egg may seem like an odd thing to add to a pizza, but all the flavors come together beautifully to create a very comforting dish.SCRAMBLED EGGS, CRISPY OYSTERS & HOT SAUCE BUTTERLike the egg on pizza above, this is a very unexpected combination of ingredients.  However, they somehow work together beautifully.  The egg was runny, just the way I like them and the crispy oysters offered a delicious contrast in both flavor and texture.  The hot sauce butter tied it all together.  This is a must-order!WOOD OVEN ROASTED MAINE LOBSTER (with Oregano & Lemon-Chili Vinaigrette)This was perhaps one of the most straight forward dishes we ordered.  While good, there was nothing outstanding about it.   It was moist, the vinaigrette was good, but I woul dnot say this is a ""must have"".Service was A+.  Our waiter was funny, attentive and answered all of our questions.  When his shift ended, he made a nice smooth hand off to our second waiter (who was also fantastic).Overall I loved my experience at ABC Kitchen and I cannot wait to go back."
Darya S.,"Queen Creek, AZ",2/18/2019,4 star rating,"ABC Kitchen doesn't need any more rave reviews, so I'll keep this short (because I still have things to say, dammit!). - this is the most enormous restaurant ever; I kept on walking and it kept on going. That's great, because it means you'll almost always be seated. There's also a variety of seating options, whether high-top and stool, or round family table, or bar, or regular two- or four-person tables. - taste is not lost on them. The decor is so unique and carefully thought out. Every corner is dripping with style, all within the uniform modern rustic theme.  - customer service is very professional and chivalrous, although slow. - had the mushroom appetizer, the sea bass entree, and the Brussel sprouts side. Everything tasted perfect, though portion sizes were way small, especially for the price, so keep the quality-over-quantity thing in mind when coming here. It's more about the exquisite presentation and the quality ingredients at ABCK. Also tried the kale salad with salmon added to it, which was actually a big portion and very lemony delicious. - special note to not sleep on the vegetables! There's definitely a special vegetable situation happening here! - coffee was great and was refilled as well. They have almond milk, score! Their iced tea looked great, too, though I didn't try it. - love how it's got the home decor extension, so you can take a fun walk after your meal!"

Gabriel G.,"Brooklyn, NY",9/19/2021,1 star rating,"I've been coming to ABC for three years. I came last week for brunch and it took over 1.5 hours to receive Eggs Benedict. The waitress assured me several times it would be out any minute. I had to beckon her several times in intervals of 15 minutes to check on it.  She finally admitted there was a mix up in the kitchen. I was expecting to not pay for it, however the waitress did not refund us but instead brought us an ice cream sundae. I am dairy free. I won't be coming back."

You order appetizers and entrees at the same time and they say they have a system that spaces everything out.Appetizers:*Crab toast with lemon aioli - not as much crab taste as I would like, but very fresh.*Chicory and roasted winter squash salad, maple-lemon vinaigrette and goat cheese - loved this, the vinaigrette had a little bit of a spicy kick to it but it worked*Pretzel dusted calamari, spicy tomato and mustard aioli - came out crispy and liked it with the mustard aioli more than the spicy tomatoEntree:*Crispy pork confit, smoked bacon marmalade and braised turnips - AMAZING. Wish I had more. The portions are small. The pork came out very tender and fell apart and the skin was perfectly crispy. There was a nice smokiness to the bacon marmalade and it was also on some mashed potatoes as well as the turnips.Dessert:*Sundae - salted caramel ice cream, candied peanuts & popcorn, whipped cream, hot fudge - A delicious dessert to share with everyone. You wouldn't think popcorn and ice cream would mix, but it does.The service was great. We asked our waitress for recommendations and she went through the entire menu explaining what were top picks, which helped us narrow down our choices or reinforce what we wanted to try!The restaurant is so beautifully decorated and it is much bigger inside than expected!The price is a little more expensive than I would like, but it's the price you pay for the quality of food and farm to table style food."

We ordered a bottle of Malbec and charcuterie to start with.  For entree I ordered halibut fish and some ordered wheat goat cheese pizza , fettuccini with a side of Brussels sprouts and linguine with brocollini. Everything  was tasty and on point with flavors. Service was great and ambiance was just right for the evening. Watch out, you might see some famous celebrities dining here."
David L.,"New York, NY",1/23/2020,1 star rating,"You'd think a restaurant that charges $34 (including tax and tip) for a cheeseburger would have the foresight to put slam-guards or a jointed-arm or felt-strips on the door to prevent it from smashing shut. Not even so much as weatherproofing or draft-stoppers so that the hostess wouldn't need to wear such a luxurious shawl for warmth! Meanwhile, I stood there--completely unacknowledged--waiting for a few minutes as the hostess continually chatted-up some lucky guy to whom she eventually gave a card before deigning to recognize that I existed... So much slamming! Slamming & slamming & slamming... But how could anyone possibly expect oversight from the administrators when the very next (jittery fidgety erratic sporadic) person I encountered couldn't even make eye contact or focus on any one thing for one single second... What an unbelievably uncomfortable experience... Ew..."
Rachel G.,"New York, NY",6/10/2019,5 star rating,I came here for dinner by myself before a show and sat at the bar.  Food starts being served at 5:30 pm.  I really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere.  The bar area is very pretty.  I had the ravioli and their service was quick.  They were very attentive to me and I enjoyed my dinner and reading during it.  It is not an inexpensive meal but I only had the one entree.  They also gave bread with olive oil.
Laurie V.,"Canton, OH",4/20/2017,4 star rating,"Had some small plates on Easter Sunday at the bar with a friend. Beets, poke tuna, and ramp toast (they are in season now).  Also had a salted caramel sundae for dessert.  An easter sundae.  I enjoyed my Mezcal Paloma.  Refreshing and good. Bartender was very sweet.Only small issue: the flies.  It was somewhat warm and stuffy at the bar and the flies were buzzing around.  But the food was top-notch."
Chris E.,"Paramus, NJ",2/9/2017,5 star rating,"5 stars just doesn't do ABC Kitchen justice!Having wanted to dine at ABC Kitchen since they won the JBF Award for Best New Restaurant in 2011, I finally had a chance to visit when I took my girlfriend here for her birthday and did we ever enjoy the experience here.The outside of the restaurant was pretty unassuming, except for the small ABC Kitchen sign right above the entrance that was quite difficult to actually see in the evening. Nevertheless, we found it. Our dinner reservation was for Saturday, 6pm --- a bit earlier for dinner than desired because they were booked to the brim that evening. I made my reservation about 1 month in advance, so that goes to show you BOOK EARLY if you want to dine here!When we walked in, we walked thru the spacious bar and feasted our eyes on a really magnificently decorated, dimly-lit and huge dining area. The tables went back as far as my eyes could see. This was one of the largest dining ""rooms"" I had ever seen in an NYC restaurant! With the lack of space in NYC, I never thought I would see a dining area so long!The restaurant was fairly empty when we arrived at around 5:50, but by the time we finished at 7:30, it was almost at capacity. Surprising in that they could get such a large restaurant completely filled, not surprising in that it's ABC Kitchen and one of Jean-Georges' gems.I've written a book and still haven't gotten to the food, so here goes. One word, AMAZING. There was not one dish that we disliked and each dish had it's own uniqueness. There was something that stood out with everything we tried. We wanted to try everything, but went with what we knew was most popular:CRAB TOAST WITH LEMON AIOLISomething we saw a lot of on Yelp and it was much better than we even anticipated. First, the toast holding the crab was very large so it was easily shared between 2 people. The crab was cold, extremely fresh and melted in our mouths. It was some of the best fresh crab meat I had ever tasted. A must start with appetizer as we saw multiple tables order this.KASHA AND BOWTIE PASTA, VEAL MEATBALLSThe restaurant allowed for 2 options, an appetizer size or entree size. Since we wanted to try more dishes, we went with the appetizer portion. OK we were starving too, but trying a little bit of everything doesn't hurt either. The dish arrived in 2 small bowls, 1 for me and 1 for my girlfriend. The pasta was cooked al dente, maybe a bit under? I'm used to pasta being very soft, but the pasta had verrrrrry slight hardness to it, but it worked to perfection. The sauce wasn't overwhelming, but gave the pasta a great flavor. The little veal meatballs were scattered all around and complimented the pasta perfectly.PIZZA - MUSHROOMS, PARMESAN,OREGANO AND FARM EGGAlthough I saw this repeatedly online, our waitress and a busboy informed us that this was their favorite pizza here, so that's all the convincing we needed. Regardless of their opinions we were going to order this pizza and it met every piece of hype I read and heard. There was a ton of mushroom scattered on the outside of the pizza next to the crust, while the egg was floating around in the middle. Everything about this pizza was tasty. The mushroom had a toasty flavor to it, the egg mixed in well and the cheese was ... well very cheesy. An absolutely flavorful pizza for the ages.BLACK SEA BASS WITH CHILIES AND HERBS, BABY MARKET POTATOES AND SPINACHSince we were 2 people, the kitchen split our entree into 2 bowls. As to why restaurant don't do this more often, I don't know, but ABC Kitchen got it right. By the time we reached this dish, we were pretty close to stuffed, but after 1 bite of the fish, we easily made a bit more room (subconsciously). The skin was very crispy and it definitely made the sea bass that much more interesting. It sat on a little bed of spinach with a few slices of potato to the side. It was simple, elegant, light and, best of all, really good.SUNDAE WITH SALTED CARAMEL ICE CREAM, CANDIED PEANUTS & POPCORN,WHIPPED CREAM, HOT FUDGEYou can't have a meal at a James Beard award winner without dessert so we forged ahead despite our bloated stomachs. We went with the popular salted caramel ice cream sundae. To sum it up, it was a huge order of 3 scoops of excellent salted caramel ice cream. Texture and taste were right on point. And if you love caramel, there was some caramel popcorn (tasted like cracker jacks) spread out over it as well.Everything about ABC Kitchen was perfect. The service was fantastic. Since it was girlfriend's birthday, I walked up to a random busboy (during a ""bathroom break"") and told him if we could get a candle and small Happy Birthday dessert for my girlfriend and they came thru when our salted caramel dessert arrived. The atmosphere was laid back, yet romantic with the dim lighting. The dress code was casual amongst not only the customers, but the waiters as well. The experience of dining here was everything and much more than we had expected!"
Matt H.,"Philadelphia, PA",3/4/2019,4 star rating,"It's been 5 years since I last ate here, but ABC kitchen still delivers. I was pleasantly surprised my group was able to get bar seating on a busy saturday night! The atmosphere is really nice and they have a variety of settings - main dining room has dim lighting that is great for dates, and no matter where you are seated, you'll be surrounded by fresh and modern decor. Likewise, the menu offers dishes with unique and refreshing taste. A few highlights:Crab toast: a delight to share with the table. Honestly I'm not a huge fan of crab to begin with, but this dish really works for me. Pairs well with the lemon aioli.Black Sea bass: Super fresh, and sits in a delicious herb broth. The fish skin was crispy, but otherwise was super moist!Pork Chop: the group's unanimous favorite - they give you a nice thick slab of juicy meat, rich in flavor. The apple mostarda was also tasty and balanced the meat well.Chocolate cake: has ganache in the filling, and has a toasted marshmellow icing - above average chocolate cake for sure!Service isn't the fastest, but the waiters were very polite and professional."

Mc K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",10/31/2020,3 star rating,"For the amount of hype this place gets, my expectations were not completely fulfilled. Atmosphere was great. Service was decent. Food wasn't particularly bad but didn't match the price point. Braised beef was my favorite dish; and it was served some root vegetables and a nice gravy. Salmon was decent, but not spectacular. Unsure if I would make a return back to this place."
Steve R.,"Woodmont Triangle, Bethesda, MD",11/26/2017,5 star rating,"Came by here for brunch on Sunday morning.  The place has a real urban vibe.  It is inconspicuously tucked into what appears to be an old warehouse with exposed concrete pillars, ductwork and wood rafters.  Good thing we got there before noon b/c the place filled quickly.Most everything is locally-sourced from local farmers' markets.We ordered the mushroom parmesan oregano & farm egg pizza, eggs and crispy potatoes w/ cheese biscuits, and the akaushi cheeseburger w/ herb mayo & pickled jalapeños.  The food was excellent.  The wait staff was courteous and attentive."
Sennett L.,"Los Angeles, CA",7/5/2017,3 star rating,"Out of the 2 reservations I made for our NYC trip, ABC Kitchen was one of them.  It was Sunday night, 9:30pm and the restaurant, although not empty, was not extremely busy.  The night started out great.  We got seated promptly, waters were delivered immediately, and server was friendly.  We ordered some appetizers and entrees to share (3 people).  First off was the Crab toast with lemon aioli.  This was delicious.  The crab was fresh and toast was crunchy!Next was the pretzel dusted calamari with spicy tomato and mustard aioli.  This was also very good.  Calamari was tender with a crispy exterior.  Both dipping sauces were really good. Appetizers arrived in a timely manner and were delicious however once we finished them, we waited almost an hour for our entrees.  About 45 minutes into our wait, we were given another appetizer on the house, heirloom tomato toast, which was also great, and told that the kitchen was a bit backed up.  Finally, our entrees arrived.  Mushroom pizza with parmesan, oregano and farm egg.  This was pretty good, with no shortage of mushrooms.  The farm egg was small and yolk was popped (not sure if that was intentional).  Not bad.Then our pasta dish was the angel hair with saffron, golden garlic, jalapeños, herbs and fresh ricotta.  This was a huge let down.  The angel hair was clumped together and cold.  The fresh ricotta was clumpy and none of the flavors really came together.  Our experience at ABC Kitchen started off great and slowly went downhill.  I'm not sure what caused the backup in the kitchen considering the restaurant didn't look as busy but it seemed as if the pasta was ready to go 30 minutes before the pizza.  Definitely an oversight on someone's end."
Brenda P.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",12/27/2016,5 star rating,"Seated at a beautiful round table for six, we relaxed and enjoyed ourselves. Chic with a side of street sass thrown in, this Jean-Georges original has fascinated me for years. Not only is the food extraordinary, but I love supporting their genuine farm-to-table efforts. Locally grown fresh produce? Mostly organic? Cruelty free-humanly treated livestock? Free of pesticides, fertilizers, insecticides, and GMOs? Yes, yes, yes! My favorite hot-sauce butter fried chicken dish is no longer available for lunch, but you can still order it off the dinner menu. Our party size allowed us to sample a good portion of the menu. #travelperks The highlights were the Ricotta and Farm Egg Raviolo and the Akaushi Cheeseburger. For dessert, the Cookie Plate and Salted Caramel Ice Cream Sundae were the crowd pleasers, as usual. I especially loved the simple and lightly sweet Almond Cake. Make sure you research what the restaurant-front looks like, to avoid getting lost as I did my first time.To say I'm excited about the upcoming ABC Kitchen Miami is to put it lightly."
Jackson M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",11/12/2020,5 star rating,"Absolutely amazing dining experience. The food was phenomenal and was presented so nicely. The environment was elegant yet not too fancy. We had multiple dishes and were very satisfied. Great place for birthdays, anniversaires, or special occasions."
Marissa S.,"Manhattan, NY",10/16/2017,4 star rating,"Love the ambiance in general, though I will always request to sit in the front of the restaurant because of the following two issues I had sitting in the back of the restaurant today: (1) we were seated right near the ABC home store, and I didn't like the heavy smell of candles that must have been lit in the store; (2) two different people thought it was appropriate to have lengthy telephone conversations right behind our table.  Really annoying.  Went for the lunch pre-fix: $34 for a three-course meal.  Food was high quality and definitely worth the price tag.  Only complaint was the portion of the butternut squash soup - seemed like it was a mini portion - like for a baby. Salmon over salad was delicious, as was the almond cake.  The starter bread was also totally delicious.  I would definitely return - preferably for the lunch pre-fixe."
Marissa G.,"Houston, TX",3/4/2019,5 star rating,"My group came to ABC kitchen last minute with no reservation (whoops) and they still found a way to get us a seat rather quickly. I'm glad they did because I loved every dish. The tuna sashimi was unexpected but amazing and flavorful. Same with the fluke, I can't decide which was better. The lobster dish did not disappoint, but was also relatively classic. Cookie plate was a fun ending, would recommend!"
Jackie W.,"New York, NY",12/5/2019,1 star rating,"I have put off writing this review to give the restaurant time to respond to my experience, but after 3 months of no response from management, it is entirely deserving to share my dining mishap.I made a reservation in September for my anniversary and was looking forward to our meal. I had been years ago but was excited to go back. We arrived and were seated promptly but were left waiting at our table for 15 minutes until being approached to order drinks.We then ordered some appetizers and 2 entrees to split, which seemed a bit overpriced but we figured was par for the course and ambiance (we live in NYC so are used to high price points, but even this seemed excessive). The crab toast was good and the calamari was also enjoyable, but small.We split the burger and fried chicken as our main course. The burger was good, I will give it that, but the fried chicken is where things really went downhill. My boyfriend took one bite of the chicken and didn't love it so opted to not eat anymore, but I kept going hoping it would grow on me. Not only did it not grow on me, but it actually kept me in the bathroom for the remainder of the dinner. I thought I just had an upset stomach and quickly requested the check, but proceeded to have food poisoning well into the early hours of the morning from the undercooked chicken, ruining my anniversary.I did what I felt was right and let the restaurant know the next day that they should be careful about cooking chicken and explained what had happened, but have not heard back since 9/28. The front desk reservationist did acknowledge his receipt of the email and the message being passed along to management, but the correspondence ended there. I even followed up later and the same thing happened.I would have expected so much more from a restaurant that claims to be high caliber. With so many options in NYC I would recommend another option any day."
adge O.,"Pleasanton, CA",2/14/2020,4 star rating,"I like the happy vibe! Fresh flowers, Casual chic, beautiful people, very friendly barman and waitress. Crab toast was incredible. My husband loved the fried chicken and I had a beef loin which was perfect! They brought us a dessert for our anniversary which was very nice!"
Matt S.,"Long Island City, NY",2/10/2020,4 star rating,"This place is a tried and true quality spot in NYC with a great ambiance and good food.Let me jump to why it is getting 4 stars vs. 5 stars: I left feeling ""That was good food and the ambiance/crowd is great (diverse,not a stuffy older corporate crowd)"" BUT I DID not leave with a ""Wow, I am going to orgasm and my wife will want another kid after this food"". Those that are true food snobs will have had better but this is a top 25% in NYC.One thing I will nitpick is that the waiter and menu should give a heads-up on the spiciness of dishes. My wife ordered the the salmon and the dijon sauce was nearly unbearable for her (I liked it but it was a smack to the face). I order the wagyu which was good but the salad had a kick as well. To top things off, we enjoyed the pizza as an appetizer (they could do a spin off pizza shop) and the pistachio creme brulee was the star for us.With all being said, you will be silly not to have dined here at least once while in NYC and folks with not hate you for recommending the spot."
Michelle L.,"New York, NY",10/11/2016,5 star rating,"I have been fortunate enough to have eaten here twice now and have yet to be disappointed with the service, atmosphere and output of delicious food. I have tried multiple memorable things and everything is really worth a try and good to share. The table typically starts off with sourdough bread and radishes to clean the palette. Radishes can back some heat so watch out! Good and fresh nonetheless.As for appetizers, we shared the crab toast which was superb. I was able to taste the crab perfectly. Smooth on top with a good crunch from the toast. As for the pasta, I got the pesto fettuccine,entrée size, and it is definitely big enough for sharing. I thought it might have needed some salt but the pesto was there and the fettuccine was al dente. I also tried the ravioli with ricotta and it was like pasta puff clouds of cheese. Super creamy and yummy. I've also tried the infamous fried chicken dish and it really meets the hype. Crunchy on the outside, moist on the inside. As for the desserts, I tried the panna cotta and the sundae. The panna cotta was all right. Pretty standard. The panna cotta was soft and creamy and the fresh peaches was a nice addition to the dish. However, the star and the best thing I have ever had at ABC Kitchen is their Sundae. OMG it is just so good. I am not really a dessert girl but I would go back just for the sundae. The caramel popcorn, caramel ice cream, whipped cream, peanuts and hot fudge. It was all just so good and everything just perfectly complemented each other. My friend literally stopped talking after he took a bite in the middle of his sentence because he was blown away at his first bite. It was just that good. It is a must get!"
Maria S.,"Whittier, CA",4/22/2017,4 star rating,"This is definitely a nice date night place. The decor is clean, simple but elegant. The ambiance is great. It's not too dark so you can see your friend/partner/dishes. The place is spacious and open.  The bread plates are all different and pretty, made from different places. The service is attentive without being pushy. Crab toast is a must have with fresh ingredients and right amount of seasoning. It's a refreshing appetizer. Meat and cheese was also a simple nice one. We ordered the sea bass and the special for that night, sirloin steak in medium rare. I have to say they were just alright. I had better sea bass and sirloin steak than these. I would say coming here is for the ambiance. Everyone raves about the salted caramel sundae on Yelp, and we did order one as well. It was way too sweet for our taste. We couldn't finish it even we had three people. Again, I would recommend this place for a date night (and if you wanna impress your date).  The ambiance is upscale and chic."
Andy B.,"Bethesda, MD",12/17/2016,5 star rating,"Jean-Georges' ABC Kitchen, its farm-to-table ethos, and its wonderfully comfortable yet elegant dining room makes for the perfect backdrop for a celebratory dinner or an evening catching up with friends. From the moment we sat down, our delightful server Clare took wonderful care of us, guiding us through the menu, telling us about both the specials and her favorites, made sure our cocktails were in good supply, and arranged for a little surprise birthday dessert for the guest of honor. The server can often make or break a dining experience, but Clare was delightful, so be sure to ask to be seated in her section when you make your reservation.The kitchen was, to no one's surprise, firing on all cylinders, turning out a series of nicely prepared dishes that really featured the fresh ingredients in a lovely, creative way. From the crab toast with lemon aioli (don't think about it, just get it) to one of the best salmon dishes I've ever had to the perfect flaky crust of the apple pie and the decadent yet not overly sweet chocolate cake, everything was just right. A great start to a fun New York weekend!"
Healy L.,"Brooklyn, NY",5/1/2021,3 star rating,It's good but not excellent.the asparagus was 2 pieces around $20-it was tasty but not special. The arris con pollo was the best thing I ate and I've had much better elsewhere. Margs were good and strong
Carline D.,"Manhattan, NY",1/13/2019,5 star rating,"Had brunch here and made reservations for some friends and I.  The host, waitstaff and ambience was awesome.  The food choices were yummy and clean.  I had the roasted salad and avocado salad...delish!  My brunch entree was scrambled egged with fried oysters with a side salad.  Also, indulged in a Grapefruit Mimosa, a cocktail and some tea.  We all split a chocolate cake with ganache and marshmallow frosting. I was thoroughly satisfied and will be eating here again."
Mal C.,"Las Vegas, NV",11/9/2018,3 star rating,"The food is still delicious and the bussing staff was wonderful, but I extend a 3 star rating because of the waiter that our table had. The waiter was rude from the first encounter. We had a five year old in the group, but he was behaving well and there was no reason to approach us sideways. We decided to share food and when a couple of plates were cleared, a busser visited to remove them. We continued to stack empty plates on the side of our table in order to make space and avoid a mess for our little one. Then, the waiter came and said we don't clear the table until everyone is finished, but in this case I will take them. I live in Las Vegas and hearing this instead of ""how is everything"" and simply removing the items was ridiculous. I felt like we were assumed to not belong in the restaurant, even though we caused no scene or trouble. While I thoroughly enjoyed my experience in 2016, I was disappointed this visit. Of the food we had, the crab toast was the best. Other items were good but not memorable. Our least favorite was the broccoli rabe. The chili was overpowering and the flavor combo was not appealing."
Kathleen T.,"Washington, DC",7/11/2017,3 star rating,I was really excited to try ABC Kitchen but found the food to be underwhelming. Table of four got the following to share: 1. Cheese and meat platter - can't go wrong here2. Carrots and avocado salad - interesting combo 3. Crab toast- suppose to be amazing but was meh 4. Burger - would not recommend 5. Sea bass- slightly plain but was my favorite of the night6. Fried chicken- not impressed after getting the fried chicken at Roister in Chicago 7.  Side of mushroom- OK  8. Side of asparagus- had a lot of flavor for being asparagus... 9. Popcorn ice cream - definitely recommend Cozy and trendy atmosphere. Appears to be a good date night spot.
Jocelyn K.,"Queens, NY",8/16/2016,4 star rating,"After dining at ABC Cocina, we stopped by ABC Kitchen to check out their menu. I've been wanting to dine here every since. I loved how the menu really tries to showcase their market vegetables.The inside of the restaurant is what I want my future house to be. Rustic and homey, but still elegant at the same time with all white furniture. A reservation is recommended, otherwise I noticed they seat you more towards the cramped bar area. It is darker in the dining room than in the bar area though. I was able to make a reservation about a week and a half in advance.Crab toast with lemon aioli - I can't believe these tiny pieces of toast was $16. So expensive, but so damn delicious. They peekytoe crab was paired on a sourdough bread toasted with butter and taste of garlic. I dislike anything mayo-like, so I avoided the aioli, but my boyfriend said you could barely taste it. I definitely recommend to order the toast and shareButtermilk and Crawford cheddar biscuits - The biscuits were super fluffy biscuits with a subtle taste of cheddar. Not like Red Lobster biscuits at all that's just dripping with grease and butter. The waitress didn't mention it to us when she asked if we wanted strawberry jam to go along with the biscuits, but the jam is an extra $3. If I had known I wouldn't have ordered the jam. $3 for jam is such a rip off. She made it sound like the jam would be included. The biscuits were great without the jam, so save yourself $3.Mushrooms, parmesan, oregano and farm egg pizza - I love how they go all out and cover every inch of the pizza with the toppings they are trying to showcase until you can't see the cheese. No surprise that the pizza was extremely mushroomy, which was enhanced by the mushroom jus drizzled on the pizza. I did think the pizza needed more salt. The toppings made the crust extremely soggy, so it was a mess eating the pizza.Summer squash, feta, caraway, chilies and lemon pizza - I loved the flavor of this pizza even more than the mushroom. The mushroom pizza had a blander and more one-note flavor in comparison. This pizza was slightly saltier with the feta. I thought it would be like mush, but the thin slices of layered yellow and green zucchini were still slightly crisp. I'd order this over the mushroom pizza next time. I found out later that my boyfriend has a friend who actually works there. His friend recommend to get the fried chicken, which unfortunately is not served during brunch. I'll have to come back for dinner just to try it."
Liz S.,"New York, NY",8/8/2018,5 star rating,"ABC Kitchen is just a little too popular (and pricey) for me. However, it's the best of the ABCs and I accept that it's a vanguard of the NYC dining scene.The host at the front had excellent people skills and dealt gracefully with having to tell pretty much everyone that their tables were ""almost ready."" We waited about 15 minutes for our table on a 7:30 reservation; I maintain that the ABCs overbook their tables. Bartenders were also great and transferred our tab easily to the table. The bar area is nice, with a tastefully distressed mirror, and there were actually a decent amount of people eating in the area, though it seemed a bit noisy to me.I started with the Barrio Paloma ($16), which fits my usual love of tequila drinks, though it is on the spicy side. My other drink of the night was a glass of minutolo ($14), which was a new grape to me but delicious. It's an unbelievably cheap bottle for retail though, and one of the first time I've seen a glass over the price of a bottle!I started with the signature crab toast ($16), which had a nice pure crab flavor on a toasty bread, and a generous amount of it. The squeeze of lemon really elevates it.Black sea bass ($34) was hands down one of the best fish I've had in a restaurant. Soft flesh, crispy skin, beautiful broth. It irks me that fish is so often seen as the boring choice (and they certainly don't make it sound too exciting on the menu) when it can be so completely flavorful. Just loved this.We also had a side of broccoli rabe ($11), which had a ""fresno chili sauce"" that I mistook for pure sriricha. They actually do a great job with double whammy of the tough texture and the bitter taste that rabe typically has, but I wouldn't say you need it.Service seamless, pacing natural. The decor here is more romantic and less try-hard than the other two ABCs. Just a nice spot with a buzzing atmosphere.It's all very simple and farm-to-table in a way that feels outmoded now, and you feel a bit silly paying these prices (it was over $100 per person with 2 drink, a starter, and a main), so it's easy to discount the experience, especially given my mixed experience with V (and to a lesser extent Cocina).However, everything was excellently done. Maintaining this level of quality is difficult, and based on Yelp and people I know who come here regularly they seem to do it. I choose to round up from a 4.5."
Avi P.,"West Sacramento, CA",2/23/2019,3 star rating,"Hey ABC kitchen, thank you for the warming service. No complains!! I gave a 3 stars review because of 2 things that bothered me-At first, the acoustic at the restaurant is kinda hard to adjust to, i had to speak veryyy loud to hear my friendSecondly, i ordered the veggie burger which came in a pita and I think that for $22 + tip I expected much more. 2 burgers and 2 small pitas would have been much nicer and money worth instead of this one burger and gigantic pita with barely any vegetables on the side."
Josie L.,"Hartford, CT",5/20/2019,3 star rating,Honestly hate to give anything but a 5 stars to ABC kitchen because I've been here so many times and it's usually amazing. The last time i went though i got a mushroom pizza with and egg and the pizza was actually wet.As a Brooklyn gal Born and raised i hate when people eat their pizza with a fork but i couldn't even pick this pizza up because it was so soggy. The flavors were great but the texture of the pizza really made it hard to enjoy! Besides the soggy pizza we had the pea soup which i always enjoy and the fluke (i think) crudo. We also had a salad with roasted carrot and avocado which were good too!
Jason W.,"New York, NY",10/30/2021,1 star rating,"I had dinner yesterday at ABC Kitchen yesterday and it was a terrible experience.  The service my waitress Alex provided I found to be extremely rushed.  I've been here before and have had a great time so it much to my surprise.  I was on a date and merely trying to enjoy my company.  The service was obtrusive, rushed and ill timed.  I have worked in the industry so I understand points of service.  Alex was determined to put us on her timing which caused much friction and never took head to any clues or warning of such service.  She had other people interact with the table as a way of being determined to have her way of rushing service to turn the table.  I found this extremely off putting as others around me seem to be able to enjoy their company at a casual pace.  If I had known ABC Kitchen was a 'turn and burn' type restaurant I would chosen somewhere else.  The last time I was there Nathan gave me his card personally so this is why I thought ABC Kitchen was a good choice.  I think the ambiance is nice but wouldn't come back if management condones such behavior from waitstaff.  At no point did Alex take any hints to my dissatisfaction which was aweful.  My evening should have been about me enjoying my company instead of a privileged server feeling that she could do no wrong and then assigning other to approach the table to rush service.  Sincerely, Jason"

Melissa D.,"Near West Side, Chicago, IL",10/15/2018,5 star rating,"Chic, modern and rustic restaurant where the food is fresh fresh fresh!!I had made reservations 30 days in advance (crazy but necessary). We arrived to the restaurant early and were not seated until 20 minutes after our reservation time, which was a little frustrating but luckily things turned around from there. We enjoyed a drink in the beautiful bar area until we were seated. The dining room is gorgeous, with lots of white wood, glass, dim lighting and rustic yet modern décor.  To start we ordered the Roast Carrot and Avocado Salad at the recommendation of a friend. I know this does not sound exciting, but it was the most fresh, delicious salad I have had in a long time. Order it! The carrots were roasted perfectly, fresh avocado, crispy seeds, large croutons with a citrus dressing-perfection! They also start you off with complimentary bread as well. We all shared the Fried Organic Chicken, which was special too and not your ordinary fried chicken. The breading was extremely light and crispy, chicken was perfect and juicy as well all sitting in a decadent butter sauce. My other favorite of the night was the Winter Squash Campanelle with parmesan and nutmeg-a perfect dish for fall. I kept having ""one last bite"" and couldn't stop! We also had on the side, the Mashed Potatoes with sea salt, and those were fantastic as well. Rich and decadent!Before arriving I wasn't all that excited about the menu choices and not sure if ABC Kitchen would live up to the hype, but it definitely went beyond my expectations with it's extraordinary twists on their dishes. It was my favorite food while visiting NYC!"
Suzanna H.,"Queens, NY",8/12/2018,5 star rating,"Came here for restaurant week. Food;You get complimentary bread. I would recommend accepting it as you can dip it into the amazing sauce from the shaved raw fluke appetizer. For the appetizer I got the Shaved raw fluke with market radishes, picked green strawberries and herbs. This was my favorite. The presentation was on point and was consistent with top quality and price. Beautiful assortment of colors, flavors, textures and finesse. This was an insta worthy dish. You are pretty much eating a garden with beautiful little flowers. The flavors we're sophisticated and blended so well together. This dish was a perfectly light and refreshing dish for the summer season. For the main course I got the seared salmon on the Bibb salad with market vegetables and a spicy buttermilk-herb vinaigrette. It was okay. It was certainly quite big and very filling. The food tasted fresh with good quality ingredients but I thought it could have been more creative. The vinaigrette reminded me of some sort of spicy ranch sauce and that wasn't something I expected in this type of establishment. So food wise, get the shaved raw fluke.Service; This was wonderful. The server was super nice and helpful. The water was constantly refilled. The dish was covered to keep it warm when I went to the bathroom. Overall just amazing service."
Hin T.,"Toronto, Canada",8/23/2016,4 star rating,"This restaurant hits high on service, food, atmosphere and originality.  Had the veal meatball pasta, organic fried chicken and mushroom pizza.  All were great but the pasta was the real standout dish.  Such a savoury and unique flavour.  You can tell this place puts forth its best effort to make your experience a good one so props to that.  The only note I have is that there were a couple dishes that we wanted try but were brunch items only (french toast and egg ravioli) and we went for dinner."

Alyson M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",2/5/2019,5 star rating,"I've already booked my next reservation here as I'm writing this. Came here for brunch on a Saturday. We had reservations at noon, but I've seen reservations for a 2pm brunch be available the day of. Biscuits- THICK and perfectly crisp. Very filling. Best biscuit I've ever had, and I went to school in the south. Carrot avocado salad- fresh, perfectly dressed. Vegetables roasted well. Croutons very tasty and unique. Crab toast- perfectly light and acidic from the lemon. tasted like it was caught 10 minutes agoSpring citrus drink- balanced between sweet and acidic, can slightly taste the alcohol (in a good way) but not overly strong Turmeric Tonic (non-alcoholic): came in wine glass and good portion. Sweeter side which I was surprised by considering the turmeric. Service was exceptional. I really enjoyed our server's personality and he was helpful with the menu. Food was delivered timely and cleared well."

Alexandra T.,"Darien, CT",10/20/2018,4 star rating,"Had been dying to try ABC Kitchen for 2 yrs and finally made it for my birthday with two gal pals on a Wed evening at 8pm. I made the reservation on open table 2-3 weeks before and didn't have a problem picking a time. As we walked in, we were seated promptly, which I always appreciate! The spot is surprisingly enormous. The fact that it is so hard to get a res here with ample seating is insane, but a great sign that there's always high demand.We started out with a bottle of chianti. It was reasonably priced for a notable restaurant in NYC. We started out with the house made ricotta and fig jam as well as the roasted carrot and avo salad. The house made ricotta was super fresh and creamy and was balanced perfectly with the sweet fig jam. The smooth textures of the jam and ricotta went so well with the toasted crostini. The roasted carrot and avo salad was surprisingly flavorful; loved how such simple ingredients had so much flavor!For my main course, I got the full portion of the campanelle in a tomato sauce with buratta, cherry tomatoes, and sausage. The campanelle was homeade and absolutely delicious!For my bday, we also split the chocolate cake, which was HUGE and phenomenal. Would definitely come back and try some of the wood fired pizzas, pretzel dusted calamari app and some different fish or meat entrees. The only complaint my group had about our experience was the poor service. We felt undermined by our waiter from the moment he spoke to us. He clearly didn't give us enough time to look over the menu and then came back every few minutes to see if we were ready yet. There was no reason for him to rush us and he could have used his social awareness skills to not ask us 4-5 times if we were ready to order within 15 min. He was also not friendly throughout the meal. When it came time to order dessert, he made a comment that the menus were on the table the entire dinner and seemed annoyed that we hadn't realized. For a meal that takes long to get a reservation and isn't cheap, I expect service to be top-notch and it was completely unacceptable that we weren't treated in a warm or respectful manner."
Lucy M.,"Queens, NY",10/10/2016,4 star rating,"I came for lunch on a Wednesday without a reservation and grabbed a seat at the bar. Obviously, the decor is beautiful. Shabby chic while still being polished, open while still being intimate. Everything from the tables to the plate ware was beautiful and bright, they really made a beautiful space. I went with the $34 prix fixe: Tuna sashimi marinated with ginger and mint, Ricotta and farm egg raviolo, pork ragu, chilies, sage and parmesan, almond cake strawberries & vanilla ice cream. To start I ordered the Mezcal Lavender Paloma with grapefruit ($16) and it was a delicious cocktail. They balanced the smokiness of the mezcal with the floral lavender perfectly, a great summer drink! The sashimi was probably some of the freshest tuna I have ever had. It practically melted in my mouth, very little chewing was necessary. And I'm not one to really care too much about presentation, but this was really very lovely in appearance, the pieces of tuna were arranged to look similar to a flower. And the flavors of the ginger and mint weren't too understated, I was worried that a classier joint would be a little too delicate with their fish but this was perfectly prepared. The entree was where things fell apart, and actually makes this review closer to 3 1/2 stars. It sounds great, it arrived looking rich and decadent. But I thought there was entirely way too much Parmesan. Some will claim you can never have enough, but it looked like my dish got caught in a snowstorm, and I didn't like how that factored into the dish when it came to texture. I also thought the pork in the ragu itself was overcooked. I was expecting something tender and almost shredded, but there were some sizable hunks in there that took too much cutting and chewing to get to. There was also a ton of sage, those wilted leaves were everywhere and were too overpowering for me. The ravioli itself was the star, with the delicious and perfectly cooked egg, and it was my favorite part. The dessert, usually my least favorite part of the meal, was delicious. The strawberries and ice cream were both so fresh, and the almond cake was moist but sturdy enough to pair with them. Overall it was an enjoyable meal with undeniably quality ingredients, but I'm not sure that I would come back without ordering from the prix fixe menu."
Danielle L.,"New York, NY",11/19/2019,4 star rating,"This is a solid restaurant and worth going to, but for me, it was also somewhat disappointing. It's just that with so many restaurants of this caliber to compare it to, this restaurant didn't wow me. The food was good. Not great. I do have dietary restrictions so that could influence my perception of the place, but I've encountered enough talented chefs who don't let that impact flavor. So yes, definitely come here. You'll be impressed by the friendly service, the great decor and the fun beverages. And don't get me wrong! The food is good. But if you ask me to dinner this Friday... I won't be asking you to take me back here."
Sunidhi G.,"Fremont, CA",7/23/2018,5 star rating,Love this place. They have lot of good vegetarian options on the menu. Service was quick and fantastic.Came here for dinner. The decor is tastefully done. Lot of space as well.However do make a reservation before you go in. Ordered roast carrot and avocado salad along with pesto fettuccine. Everything was very flavorful. One of the best meals I had. Portion sizes were ok. If you are hungry order the dinner portions. Servers are well informed and would ask for our preferences to recommend items from the menu. We were done in less than 2 hours. Everything was perfect.Definitely coming back here again!!
Steve L.,"New York, NY",3/24/2017,5 star rating,"Lunch review.This place rocks. Service is snappy and food is incredible. I came here with my brother, sister-in-law, and 3 year-old niece on a Saturday early afternoon. No reservation, no problem. Promptly seated and waited on. It was tough to decide whether to go more breakfast-style or lunch, since any dish you see pass by would sway you one way or the other. But, I'm generally more of a savory eater - so lunch it was. We pretty much shared everything, and we got:Apps:Pretzel crusted calamari - a really interesting twisted on your standard fried calamari dish; crispy and served with a delicious mustard sauce.Roasted kabocha squash toast with fresh ricotta and apple cider vinegar - yum!  I was a little skeptical - I like squash and all, but on toast? Yes. A tad little bit on the sweet side, but still really good.Crab toast - Bam. Yuuuge chunks of crab, served with slaw and a lemon aoli. These flew off the plate.SideRoasted Brussels Sprouts, Prosciutto, Apples and Herbs - I love me some brussels. This was no exception.MainsMushrooms, Parmesan, Oregano and Farm Egg Pizza - First off, I love that the pizzas are whole wheat. Decadence with a side of health(er).  Fantastic. A little bit of a tough time to cut, but just great. The runny egg kicked this guy off to the next level.Spinach, Goat Cheese and Herbs Pizza - Disclaimer that I'm pretty obsessed with goat cheese, so this was just the overall winner in my book. To die for.Dessert:Salted Caramel Ice Cream Sundae - You had me at salted caramel...ice cream...sundae. VerdictGo eat here immediately."
Stephen C.,"Cincinnati, OH",9/3/2018,5 star rating,"Coming from the Midwest, my expectations were not very high for a 'farm to table concept' in the middle of Manhattan.  However, I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurants ability to serve up traditional American fare (much of which is sourced organically and locally) and at the same time provide a contemporary twist on these dishes.Huge fan of the interior environment, a mixture of modern and rustic.  I love the spacious seating arrangements - probably one of the most spacious, private seating arrangements for four I have experienced in an popular manhattan restaurant.  Food is exactly what I would expect from a farm to table concept - traditional dishes with focus on fresh organic ingredients. Appetizers - calamari is awesome - fresh, not chewy, and perfect amount of outside crisp.  Crab toast is probably their most popular appetizers - it was very good - overflowing with crab meat and they allow the crab to shine with low seasoning / mayonnaise.  Cheese and meat board was also good - appreciated how the waiter spent a good deal of time explaining the sourcing and preparation of each item.  Roasted carrot salad was also very good and would recommend for a share.Entrees - hands down the fried chicken is the best dish on the menu - and probably is one of the best in the city.  Super juicy chicken breast and an amazing light breading around it.  The breading is so light and crispy I thought it was a cream puff outside initially.    The pork chop is probably my number 2 on the menu.  Beautifully prepared with the perfect cook and seasoning.  Sea bass closely follows the pork chop, and would be a great lighter fare option.  Wrapped up the meal with a decadent blue berry cobbler with a side of goat milk ice cream.  I usually am not a fan of anything goat related - however the added sharpness to the ice cream as the perfect compliment to the sweet cobbler.Awesome meal. Highly recommend.  Use open table to book in advance as they get very busy.  Will be back."
Jennifer R.,"New York, NY",7/29/2016,5 star rating,"I came here for lunch during NYC Restaurant Week. It was a really amazing decision and an all-around really incredible dining experience.The restaurant itself is super nice. It's classy, warm, modern and welcoming. You walk through the bar area and ABC Cocina to the little kitchen area in the back, closest to the store. The wait staff was waiting to welcome us with water, bread, olive oil and sea salt. We ordered from the restaurant week menu. I had the shaved fluke, the raviolo with pork ragu and the grilled peaches with pistachio ice cream. All three of these things I normally would not have ordered, but I'm super glad I did.Everything was incredibly delicious. I was so impressed by how well the flavors all complemented one another in each dish. The raviolo was probably the star for me - egg yolk, pork, sauces, chiles, pasta - all perfectly harmonized into a perfect lunch portion. :) I can't wait to come back here and try the cocktails and dinner menu, but restaurant week was a great introduction to an incredible dining experience at ABC Kitchen!"
Emily B.,"Minneapolis, MN",1/28/2020,5 star rating,"Lovely! We went for lunch during restaurant week. Bread is served with oil. The cauliflower soup was delicious. It had a little spice to it, but not too much. The salmon salad for lunch was also a treat. The notes of fennel we were a nice touch."
Vijay S.,"Providence, RI",7/21/2016,4 star rating,"Came here for lunch after hearing so much about it on restaurant week and time out. I was impressed with the decor and the chic feel of the place as soon as I walked in.Got the shrimp salad which was good, a little too tangy maybe for me. The shrimp was very fresh and delicious. Also got the strawberry ice tea which was good. I would probably come back for their lunch prix fixe menu for 34$ which is pretty reasonable. The bartenders and staff were all very friendly."
Izzo C.,"New York, NY",4/8/2018,2 star rating,"UGGGHHH!!!!really wondering if we picked a bad night, or if people are too blinded by the novelty of this place to rate it fairly.i should've smelled the fishiness when the lady on the phone urged us against making a reservation earlier that day for later that evening (presidents day - a monday), reassuring us that the wait would be fine; the adamance seemed kind of weird, but i didn't think much of it at the time. upon arrival, we were told that it would be 45 mins and that we could chill over by the back bar for the time being -- hmm ok, no biggie...except for the fact that it actually ended up taking 70 MINS and that we NEVER made it to the back bar because the host never got back to us!!we hoped that these little blunders would be redeemed by a better dinner, but that thought quickly dwindled when it took speaking with 3 different servers to place our orders. entrees were pretty good, but not to the extent to which i can justify them not filling us up. dessert was more or less satisfactory (would recommend the chocolate creme brulee), but took too long to come out to be thoroughly enjoyable. cmon ABC......"
Nicholas C.,"Brooklyn, NY",5/29/2018,5 star rating,"This isn't the first time I've visited ABC Kitchen and it definitely wont be the last. Everything from the food to the service has always been phenomenal. However, this particular experience was so good it's already had me planning for the next time I'll be able to dine here again!Our party of 4 walked in on a Friday evening at around 7:15 PM. Since we didn't have a reservation we were told that we could be seated immediately at the restaurant's communal table or wait until about 9 PM until an actual table opened up. We opted for the communal table, but were also told that since we were a party of four it was likely no one else would be seated at that table with us, which ended up happening! Regardless, definitely be sure to make a reservation if you're looking to dine here for any meal of the day. ABC Kitchen itself emulates a posh french countryside estate (in my mind). Set up with white tables and chairs, along with plants strewn across the space, it definitely gives off nature vibes while still being extremely romantic. Small candlelight's on the table also make this a must for a special date night. When it came time to order our party started with the Housemade Ricotta with Rhubarb and Grilled Bread ($15), along with the Crab Toast with Lemon Aioli ($16). Both appetizers were beautifully prepared and extremely flavorful. You can't go wrong if you order any of these for yourself.When it came time to order our entrees, I ended up choosing the Crispy Pork Confit with Smoked Bacon, Marmalade, and Braised Turnips ($36). This dish really blew it out of the park for me. The pork confit was cooked PERFECTLY. A hearty portion that was also organized well with the other items on the plate. The marmalade added sweet notes to the dish, while the turnips also increased the variety of flavors I indulged in that night. All in all this is a MUST if you're on the fence, or indecisive about what to order.For dessert we ordered the Rhubarb Pie with White Chocolate Ice Cream ($14) and the Chocolate Creme Brulee with Blood Orange Sorbet and Hazelnut ($12). The pie itself was alright, but what really stood out was the creme brulee. Warm from beginning to end, each bite was just as good as the last. The only thing that that left me disappointed was the portion size, but this also may be due to how fast our party devoured this particular dessert. :)Overall this was a great experience from beginning to end, especially since we walked in without a reservation. The servers and staff were hospitable and accommodating from the moment we arrived. I'd definitely put ABC Kitchen on your map if you're looking for the perfect dimly-lit date spot or somewhere to celebrate a special occasion. You can be sure that this restaurant won't disappoint."
Brittney G.,"Round Rock, TX",1/3/2019,5 star rating,"All I can say is wow! This was one of the best meals I've had in awhile! Let's start with the customer service! We were a group of 10 there for our office Christmas party. The menu was personalized along with company name etc. everything was family style so it takes away from having to make a decision and you can just try everything on the menu. The waiters/waitresses went above and beyond. Anything we needed, they accommodated and the execution of this meal was flawless! Let's get on to the food:For the appetizers we had the sashimi tuna, the beet salad, and the ricotta cheese. Oh my god, I have never enjoyed beets but this beet salad was sent by the gods!! The tuna had a perfect flavor combination and the ricotta cheese was brilliantly smooth with a lite flavor. Not as harsh as some ricotta cheeses I've had. We also had the crab toast, the calimari, and the spinach pizza as well as the mushroom pizza. Everything was so fresh and flavorful!For the main courses: we had the pork chop, the ricotta ravioli and the seared salmon. Again, all executed perfectly. The pork chop was paired with spicy apples who've I have never experienced before but was so very pleased! For the sides: we had the mashed potatoes with sea salt, soooo creamy and flavorful!For desserts: we had the chocolate cake, the sundae with caramel pop corn and the almond cake. I was not a huge fan of the desserts I thought they were a bit too complex and needed to push back a bit on the strong flavor. But not bad at all, I didn't eat much of them honestly simply because I was so full from the rest of the meal!Thank you ABC Kitchen for such a pleasant experience! I will be back!"
Melissa S.,"Houston, TX",2/3/2019,5 star rating,"One of my favorite restaurants in NYC. Consistently excellent service a food year after year. You definitely need to make reservations in advance as this restaurant is a staple for trendy dinning. On my most recent visit, I mixed up the times of the reservation and arrived 1 1/2 hours late...they were understanding and still able to accommodate us. Food while a little pricy is delicious and I don't think you could go wrong with anything on the menus. I highly recommend the grab toast and salmon (if on the menu)."
Alexander C.,"Brooklyn, NY",11/25/2019,4 star rating,"I've been coming to ABC Kitchen a few times with my coworkers for some after work meals and I've always been a fan. But recently went their for a date and put in my reservation. It took some time for them to set up my table, but the staff were extremely nice and attentive to our needs. I was always a fan of their cocktails and I would highly recommend their vodka lemonade thyme. I have never been disappointed by the drink and their sugar rim adds a hint of sweetness to the refreshing drink.We ordered crab toast and shave fluke as a starter. The crab toast was really good with generous amount of crabs, but I can not say the same to their shaved fluke. I think the beets were a bit overwhelming which over powered the flavor to the fluke.For the entrees we ordered Mushroom pizza, sea bass and fries. The pizza was surprisingly good with the egg in the middle. I would highly recommend that to order if you're planning to share a dish, but I would go away from their sea bass which was way too lemony and ruined the sea bass flavor. Overall the service and drinks were great, but the sea bass and fluke brought down how I would rate them from 5 start to a 4 start restaurant."
Grace Y.,"San Francisco, CA",7/3/2018,4 star rating,"The ambience is amazing - quiet, dark but open and airy. Just loud enough to feel energy, but also have a conversation without being too loud. Highlights: tuna, crab toast, sea bass, the Broccolini side and THE BURGER.Drinks were made perfectly too!Knocking a star because we kept asking ourselves, is this food really delicious or did they just overseason and add a lot of salt? Either way, we didn't care - it was ALL DELICIOUS."
Sandy L.,"New York, NY",2/5/2017,5 star rating,"By far my most favorite restaurant for a small date. The atmosphere of these restaurant is quite amazing, the interior is beautiful. The staffis as friendly as they can be, but the main course about this restaurant is the delicious absolutely delicious food! I've been here quite a few time, never fail to impress me. I've tried their pizzas before, pasta, appetizers, they keep the same standards for food. I typically don't like ordering fish at a restaurant because fish is the hardest seafood to make taste different yet good. But my boyfriend ordered the hake and we're totally impress. All the flavor brings out each other. The presentation is phenomenal."
Eugenia L.,"Los Angeles, CA",5/3/2016,5 star rating,The restaurant is beautiful inside! Very chic and modern.. Kind of a mixture of urban outfitters and the interior of the restaurant Fig and Olive in Beverly Hills. Very white and clean furniture mixed with plants and tree trunks. We came as a party of 7 around 9pm without a reservation so we knew we would have to wait a while for the table. We waited around an hour.. which was expected so we just waited at the bar. Ordered wine and the crab toast which was amazing. Comes in 4 pieces so the sizes are not ginormous. The bartender actually recommended this appetizer since it was one of their most popular dishes. Definitely did not go wrong with this decision. Loved all 4 bites of it. I ordered the kale salad to share along with the black bass. I was looking for something on the lighter side and this was exactly what I was looking for. The sauce is not creamy or thick. It is more on the light broth-like taste. Came with lightly sauteed spinache and potatoes. Portions are not too big so ordering appetizers is a good idea! Their appetizers are delicious as well. I shared the kale salad with 2 other girls and it was a good amount of vegetables for a meal's worth diet. Highly recommend coming to this restaurant! They have other restaurants as well. Wanted to try abc cocina but will try that next time if I ever get a chance!
Edward W.,"San Mateo, CA",6/16/2016,3 star rating,"Decided to try this place because my friend's manager said this was his favorite restaurant.Started off with the crab toast, which had lots of fresh crab spread on top and ended up being the best thing I had here.The miso sea bass was very moist and cooked right, but the miso flavor was pretty lacking and the dressing was very sour. Friend ordered the house cut fries which had a very strong onion flavor. I thought it was alright and a nice twist.$$$ for what it was."
M. S.,"Manhattan, NY",1/28/2020,2 star rating,"For a check that was over $300 for 2 people, I find it ridiculous that ABC Kitchen was out of bread for a 9:15 PM reservation and they packed my black sea bass dish with soup in a porous container that COMPLETELY leaked through the paper bag within the less than 10 minute ride home."
Serena S.,"Jersey City, NJ",10/4/2018,4 star rating,"I've been here twice before. The first time I came with my friend and our meal was very rushed. We came on a Friday night and they had us in and out within 45 minutes. We felt like we couldn't enjoy our meal. We ordered drinks, appetizers, and mains and they still rushed us through it very quickly. The food was good, but the overall experience that time was a 3/5. The next time I came was on a Thursday and it was definitely a 5/5! We sat there for about 3 hours and enjoyed our meal. The appetizers, wine, and main dishes were all Delicious. Good portions and tasty food! The service was also great and the server was very patient with us while we took our time with ordering and eating! I would recommended the ricotta ravioli and toast with heirloom tomatoes"
Anna I.,"Vancouver, WA",4/7/2018,5 star rating,Wow! All I can say is I'm glad this was my first meal in New York. I got the cheese and mushroom stuffed pasta and my girlfriend tried the chicken with spicy collared greens. This was our favorite meal in New York and would recommend this place to anyone visiting.
Jenn P.,"Manhattan, NY",3/14/2016,4 star rating,"I am honestly shocked that I am writing this 4-star review right now.  I visited ABC Cocina last summer and had such an awful experience that I swore off Jean-Georges restaurants until just recently.  I hesitantly made a reservation for a small reunion at ABC Kitchen, and I'm glad I did.  I went on a weeknight with some girlfriends.  Myself and another member of our party were both over 10 minutes late, and they kindly sat our third friend on time, which I thought was super cool of them.  They also didn't make me feel horrible about being late.  Bonus points there.  The restaurant itself is very cute inside.  It is trendy and very open.  We ordered drinks first.  I got the Mezcal lavender Paloma, which I did not love.  One of my other friends got the ginger margarita, which I preferred.  I would probably do that drink if I could do it over again.APPETIZERSMUSHROOM TOAST: Served with cheese, lemon, and herbs.  I LOVED this.  Thick, crunchy bread.  They pre-divide the toast into 3 pieces, so it's easy to share.CRAB TOAST: Served with lemon aioli.  I liked this a lot but preferred the mushroom toast.  I felt like we had to order this because of how wildly popular it is.  I certainly enjoyed it.TUNA SASHIMI: OMG yes.  Small portion but amazing.  Very thin pieces of tuna in a sauce made with ginger, mint, and apparently fairy magic because this was amazing.ROAST CARROT & AVOCADO SALAD: I hate cooked carrots but even I could get down with this.  Reasonable portion of carrots, avocados, and some seeds.  I liked it.ENTREEROASTED HAKE: I split the hake entree with my friend.  It was served with potatoes and broccoli in a reddish orange chili sauce.  They let us put the sauce on the side and they pre-split the entree for us.  I really enjoyed this a lot - it certainly has a kick to it though, so put the sauce on the side if you are wary of spicy food.DESSERTSUNDAE: Huge sundae with caramel ice cream, peanuts, and popcorn.  It's kind of hard not to like this.  Great size for sharing.  The service was mostly good; our waiter was very knowledgeable and helpful.  All of the staff was polite.  I did feel a little rushed - one of the clearers asked me if I was done with my entree while I was still chewing (more funny than anything so no big deal).  I liked that our server was able to make recommendations based on what we said we liked.Total bill came to $211 for 3 people - it wasn't cheap, but the food was good and we left full, so I wasn't annoyed either.  It was the type of experience that made me rethink ABC Cocina (maybe we went on a really off day?) - I'm really glad that I gave this place a shot.  Would recommend."
Jen L.,"Los Angeles, CA",7/12/2016,3 star rating,"To be honest, I was pretty disappointed with this Jean-Georges restaurant. I came here for brunch on a Friday, and there seemed to be a good amount of seating available at 12pm. I ordered the Crab Toast, which was heavy with an extremely strong, fishy aftertaste (even after I used the 2 lemons). This level of fishy flavor was definitely not expected. I had to force myself to finish the 4 pieces. The Roast Carrot and Avocado Salad was pretty good - the carrot was perfectly roasted and the seasoning was unique. They are generous with the avocado servings. I tasted my friend's Shrimp Salad and it was okay - nothing amazing.Overall, this place wouldn't sit high in my recommendation list. The service was meh and the food was not worth the hype in my opinion. The farm-to-table concept is great, though."
Valerie V.,"Raleigh, NC",12/22/2019,4 star rating,"3.75 stars, rounded up. The ambience and staff at this restaurant are great. The menu seems unique. I was not wowed, and I generally am somehow with something at a restaurant of this caliber in NYC when I visit. The arugula salad was good. The crab toast was great. I ordered the tagliatelle with shaved black truffles and fresh mozzarella. I even asked our server what she thought and she said this was a favorite. I was really excited, as I generally am for delicious pasta. This dish was actually beyond boring. Which is hard to do with black truffles, right?  The flavor profile was bland. Nothing stood out, including the truffle taste. The sauce was just ok, nothing extra to add pizazz. Could maybe use some red chili flakes or something to kick it up. Sun dried tomatoes or spinach or mushrooms or SOMETHING. Anything for a $34 pasta that I would pass up for the mushroom ravioli at Olive Garden (yes I went there, to the Walmart of Italian restaurants). The sea bass was also just ok as was the ravioli (very plain dish). Not sure that I would return but the company was good and we had a good time."
Danae L.,"Fremont, CA",7/2/2018,2 star rating,"Perhaps I ordered the wrong items, but I had her expectations for ABC kitchen that were not met.And I started with the lobster toast and that was spectacular. But everything else went downhill afterwards. As previous reviews mentioned the sea bass is highly recommended, but ours came out bland and salty.The mushroom pizza looked popular, but there was too much for me to enjoy so I went for the ravioli. That was also bland and salty as well. $99 for brunch that was bland and salty, I think not."
Kaitlin M.,"Seattle, WA",7/13/2018,4 star rating,"Delicious food, elegant decor, and terrific waitstaff. Our waitress was super sweet and attentive and gave great recommendations.My good friend and I ordered appetizers, entrees, and desserts and it was ALL delicious. You can't go wrong here. The Housemade Ricotta with Strawberry Compote and Grilled Bread was super tasty and the Black Sea Bass was SO flavorful.Per my friend's recommendation, we ordered the sundae for dessert; salted caramel ice cream, candied peanuts and popcorn, topped with whipped cream and hot fudge. Amazing--a wonderful way to end the meal."
Jordan M.,"New York, NY",9/14/2021,1 star rating,"90% sure the staff at this restaurant stole my purse. Dined here for a business dinner and after the check was signed I went to grab my tote with my laptop, phone, wallet, etc and after I realized it was missing the manager politely told me ""according to cuomo I had 30 min to figure out what to do before I had to leave at 12."" He gave me a business card and said it would get sorted out in the motioning and  when I called the number on the business card it was nothing more than the reservation hot line. I had no way of getting ahold of the restaurant after they did  absolutely nothing to help me the night before and I did not get ahold of anyone for 3 days. No apology, no trying to help me find it or figure out a way home with no wallet. The entire situation was so incredibly bizarre and upsetting, especially after spending a couple hundred dollars on dinner. So if you care about your belongings hold on to them because the waiters or staff might snag. As for the food, they were out of a lot of things on the menu and of the things they did have they were average. Ordered the salmon and it tasted how I'd expect ordering salmon from cheese cake factory on postmates to taste."
Neeraj B.,"Midtown East, New York, NY",9/14/2021,1 star rating,"Terrible service.  Waited for 10 min before we had ask them to serve us water.  Another 10 min before the waitress gave us the menu.  Half way through us placing an order she walks away and comes back after two minutes.  Food used to be fantastic, just about ok now.  This was one of our favorite restaurants and we chose it for a special occasion.  Never again!"
Foodie M.,"San Francisco, CA",11/16/2020,1 star rating,"I came here for a birthday dinner: the food was tasty and the staff was attentive. However, after getting home and looking over the bill, I realized the bill included a bottle we never ordered. Probably, should have checked the bill before paying, but since it was a birthday, I was not really in the mood. Having gotten home and having looked over the bill sometime later, I contacted the restaurant about the issue. The manager apologized and said that the staff ""placed a bottle on our table"" by mistake, instead of placing it for the other party. But there were no bottles on our table at any point that night. The manager told me that the amount was credited back to my account, as well as the tip amount associated with the item. Having looked over my statements a few weeks later, I discovered the full amount has not been credited back, despite representations to the contrary. I had to again reach out to the restaurant to have it fixed. I understand everyone makes mistakes, but this situation feels like one mistake too many. The dinner bill exceeded $1,000 and how the restaurant approached the issue afterwards was poor. I am not in the habit of checking my credit card statements or bills after dinners at establishment of this level, but will do so if I am ever back at ABC Kitchen. I encourage everyone to check their bills when received at ABC Kitchen to make sure no extra items have been added to the bill, since the restaurant may require several follow ups to get a proper refund afterwards."
Eileen K.,"New York, NY",12/1/2016,4 star rating,"Came here for randomly for dinner Sunday late night since we were in the neighborhood and always hear about people coming here. We waited for about 15 minutes. The menu was very interesting I must say. I would probably come back, but only once the menu changes. Roasted beets with housemade yogurt was very good, although I felt like it was missing something.Cured meats & local cheeses were so good! Very generous prosciutto portion. One thing I didn't like was the extra strong / spicy mustard, but you don't have to try it if you don't want to.Pretzel dusted calamari. Not sure what exactly hoe it was pretzel dusted, but I will assure you that it was delicious!Spinach and goat cheese pizza was extremely yummy!!! I then used the sauce from the calamari to dip my crust into it.Brussels sprouts were amazing. Service was good, our waitress was very friendly. Loved the ambience, I thought the decor was great."
Jonelle T.,"Bellevue, WA",1/15/2016,5 star rating,"I'm so glad I got to check ABC Kitchen off my list! I've attempted to eat here before, but getting a reasonable reservation time is tough, even when you make one over a month out. This time around, I bit the bullet and took a 9pm slot. It was now or never.First off, the space is gorgeous, and connected to ABC Carpet & Home, but I'll save that for another trip. I would describe the decor as rustic chic, and the white furniture proved to be the perfect backdrop for the beautifully plated food. On to the food! ABC Kitchen commits to using the freshest organic and local ingredients possible, and the seasonal menu reflects that. We were ravenous by the time 9pm rolled around, so we may have gone a smidge overboard with the food, but no regrets!On the menu:Baked sweet potato with chili butter and sea saltCrab toast with lemon aioliShaved raw fluke, meyer lemon, rosemary, orangePear and apple salad, blue cheese dressing, fine herbs and candied pecansRicotta ravioli, herbs and tomato saucePizza with mushrooms, parmesan, oregano and farm eggBlack sea bass with chilies and herbs, baby market potatoes and spinachSwiss chard, balsamic and parsleyApple pie with maple pecan ice creamHands down, the best whole wheat pizza crust I have ever had in my life. It was just perfectly chewy, crispy, and just thick enough to hold up to the cheese and mushrooms. To us, the weakest dish was actually the sea bass entree. It was just a bit too bland compared to everything else.Since the menu changes seasonally to capitalize on what's fresh, I'd love to come back for lunch or brunch. Overall, dinner was worth it, even at 9pm on a Sunday."
Ashley V.,"Brooklyn, NY",4/8/2018,5 star rating,"Coming here really feels like a treat. The interior is so cute and cozy, the servers were attentive and the food was phenomenal. I came with a group and we were able to sample quite a few things:Cured Meats & Cheeses: I felt like this was just okay. If you're wanting some apps to share I'd probably pass on this one. Nothing was wrong with it, I just wasn't blown away.3/5Crab Toast: this was super light and delicious. Just the right amount of acidity. Would recommend.4/5Butternut Squash Toast: I think this had ricotta on it but I can't remember the type of cheese 100% (the menu recently switched and I no longer see this option.) That being said, this was by far my favorite appetizer of the night! A little sweet, a little salty, and I truly wished I didn't have to share this one with the group.5/5Tuna Sashimi w/Ginger & Mint: another huge hit. I could've eaten an entire order of this by myself. The marinade was to die for and the fish was super fresh.5/5Pretzel Calamari: a little underwhelming. You couldn't really tell the breading was pretzel (and I never would have guessed if the menu didn't say so). To be fair, I like calamari but it isn't a must order for me, so the fact that this didn't really feel special puts it lower on my list. It just seemed like regular fried calamari to me.3/5Tomato/Mozz/Basil Pizza: a classic dish done well. Everyone loved this and finished the pie with no complaints.4/5Ricotta Ravioli: someone else at my table ordered this and I was drooling over it all night. You get a fair amount of ravioli and this was definitely a nice, hearty dish.4/5Wood Oven Roasted Lobster: OH MY GOODNESS! I ordered this for my entree and I loved it so much, I could've eaten two. It's seasoned with oregano and a lemon-chili vinaigrette which made the taste really intersting, unique, and not something you'd normally expect from lobster. It was different (in a good way) and I'm totally here for it. Best lobster I've had in a long while, and it was both seasoned and cooked to perfection.6/5 Broccoli Rabe: delicious and a good way to sneak some veggies in! It had a chili sauce on it but I couldn't really taste it.3/5Mashed Potatoes: so creamy and flavorful. Order a few for the table, because everyone will want seconds.5/5Overall, I'd definitely come back here. I love that the menu is seasonal so you get to try a few new things that are fresh and in-season. Can't wait for my next ABC dining experience."
Leng Leng Y.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",7/26/2018,5 star rating,"Food: One of the best culinary experiences I have had for a while. Every dish was perfectly crafted to stimulate the right senses! I came here for restaurant week and had the raw fluke (highly recommended!) -- absolutely flavorful and refreshing for the summer. For the entree I ordered the salmon salad which was perfectly cooked medium rare and that dressing though... Drinks: Wow I am impressed with the cocktails! I did not expect their drinks to be as good as their food items! The barrio paloma was perfectly mixed and recommended for mexcal lovers or not! They have a huge wine list but could not pass up the cocktails!Vibe: Elegant, boutique, and its located inside a department store. What else could you ask for?"
Ivy C.,"CA, CA",10/7/2019,4 star rating,"Really beautiful inside. I couldn't really tell how the restaurant was going to be since there was scaffolding around the entrance. Once you walk in, the restaurant opens up and is gorgeous.Overall amazing food and drinks. Ordered the crab toast (a must have!) cauliflower soup (seasonal), carrot and avocado salad, fettuccine with pesto, and the famous cheeseburger. Favorite was the crab toast and pasta. The cheeseburger meat was really well seasoned and very tasty, but the bun was a bit much. Service was also on point. Our main server was sometimes tied up with a larger table nearby, but everyone around was always stepping up to get us another glass of wine, our check or something else."
S C.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",11/20/2019,5 star rating,"I'll keep this short and simple.There's many good restaurants in nyc, this one, is certainly on the top 5 to visit....Food = 5/5Service = 5/5Ambiance = 5/5Location = 4/5 This place is a must visit. Had practically all menu items on multiple visits over months, and it never disappoints. The salmon I had was just amazing, to add, the broth of the sea bass..made me go a little Wild turkey and dip the bread in the sauce....ladies and gents...I dipped the bread in the sauce at a fine dinning experience...who cares, I wanted that flavor all types of ways.... simply put, GO for your self.A bit pricey, but worth it"
Conor S.,"Seattle, WA",9/29/2018,5 star rating,Mmmmm yum! Really enjoyed this place for lunch. Lots of options and we tried a free things. Coffee was good. The ravioli was amazing and so were the roasted carrots. I would highly recommend this place to someone visiting New York. The service was amazing. Food was fresh and everything went off without a hitch.
Sheila R.,"Summit, NJ",4/18/2016,5 star rating,"What a great Sunday brunch celebration! Perfect ending for our nyc overnight.Some started with cocktails,  others with their housemade juices. Both were excellent. Going for the house specialties, I started with the crab toast. It was a huge portion with great garlic and lemon flavor. Personally, I don't like mayonnaise that much and would have preferred a bit less of that. The other appy we had was the pesto with goat cheese,  which was great.Entrees. ..I ordered the roasted carrot and avocado salad. There were an extraordinary number of different flavors and textures with a curry like flavor. The bf ordered the cheeseburger,  which he said that the meat was amazing and yay!!! it was served with fries.Also,  we had a huge turkey sandwich which was devoured, served with fries. There was also a homemade veggie burger which was served in a pita with a shredded carrot salad. Just an FYI, prices were expensive and most portions were on the smaller side.  With that said, we thoroughly enjoyed our entire meal and had excellent,  attentive service. Yay!!!"
Hypex O.,"Queens, Queens, NY",8/17/2019,5 star rating,"Probably the most famous ABC Kitchen dish, this crab toast with lemon aioli is still the best thing on the menu. Order one per person.Roasted Kabocha Squash ToastNope. Too dense, and way too sweet. The squash is super starchy, as is the thick whole grain bread it's served on. I think this may still be sitting at the bottom of my stomach.Kale SaladMaybe one of the most obvious examples of a lack of quality control. Our kale salad here was straight up bad. The kale ribbons were soggy and cut too thick, and the dressing had little flavor other than raw lemon juice. No thanks."
Sean B.,"Manhattan, NY",8/23/2020,5 star rating,"Fabulous as usual and now with a special bonus. They will now serve dishes from any of the three restaurants (Kitchen, Covina and V) at any of the outdoor tables. I think ABCv is hands down the best vegetarian restaurant ever, and now you can pair their amazing dishes with meat dishes from the other two restaurants. This is New York foodie heaven. And our server Janie made a fantastic meal even better with her professionalism and great personality. A wonderful experience. Thank you."
Ferdinand C.,"New York, NY",9/3/2018,4 star rating,"Delicious. A group of us stopped by for dinner and we errr able to be seated in the bar area. Service did start off slow but our waiter became more attentive eventually. We started with the fluke, cucumber soup, goat cheese pizza, fettuccine, calamari, and crab toast. It sounds like a lot of appetizers but the portion sizes were small so we were able to order entrees as well. Everyone agreed the food tasted good but our favorites were the pizza, pasta, and crab toast. Everything did taste fresh and homemade. For entrees we got the sea bass, monkfish, and pork chops. We didn't really share but everyone enjoyed their own respected dishes. For dessert we got the chocolate cake and almond cake. Both were different and yummy in their own way. Would def recommend this place for good food and atmosphere."
Ameya B.,"New York, NY",12/11/2015,5 star rating,"My wife's company had organized a Christmas Party here and we absolutely had a blast here! Their staff is extremely attentive and friendly. Needless to say, the service was top notch!We tried a bunch of appetizers, but a clear winner of the night was the Line caught tuna sashimi marinated with ginger and mint. The flavor is out of this world! I began to wonder how something as simple as this, can be so damn delicious!For our entrees, most of us ordered the Sea Bass with chilies and herbs, baby market potatoes and spinach -- again, flavor wise, just amazing. The fish was cooked to perfection!Since we didn't really pay, I had an amazing experience, but I'd agree with a few other reviews indicating the value for price issue. The entree on their regular menu is priced at $32 which is a bit too much for the rather smaller portions!"
Adelheid M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",7/29/2018,1 star rating,"Sunday July 29th, 2018. I'm here for brunch and I ordered scrambled eggs with potatoes for $16,00. I asked on the side smoke salmon and the barista said is $20,00 for that side because is organic....really? WTF!!! When I saw my plate I was shocked, the scrambled eggs look like DOG food! Horrible Never again!"
Niqua L.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",4/2/2020,4 star rating,"Very fancy, white table cloth restaurant. There was construction going on when I visited so I walked past it a few times. The meals are very light and made w delicacy."
Kimberly T.,"San Francisco, CA",4/19/2018,3 star rating,"This place is so difficult to get a reservation at, and the decor/table setup are beautiful. The food, though good, is nothing that memorable -- it's high quality ingredients and well-cooked, but there's nothing that distinctive about the dishes that make it that different from other meals I've had in the past. My entree (the sea bass) was juicy/tender, but didn't have too much flavor.The restaurant itself is beautiful and the service is nice."
Karen C.,"Dunellen, NJ",9/25/2018,4 star rating,"Came here for Sunday brunch with a friend, we shared the French toast (it was amazing!), avocado salad, and buttered biscuits. They also give you bread for the table, so keep that in mind when ordering! Our food was all very good and high quality, they're all about serving local produce. You definitely pay NYC prices but the ambiance is really nice and if you want a bougie experience go here. The company owns a furniture store and it's connected around back, which explains all the interesting furniture pieces. I'd recommend a visit!"
June F.,"Merrick, NY",11/7/2019,5 star rating,Loved this spot!  Came to meet a girlfriend for lunch and ordered the salad with grilled chicken.  It was special!  Service was great and so was the cappuccino!  Will definitely come back!
Jerrius J.,"Fort Smith, AR",1/29/2018,5 star rating,"Set a reservation for 5 at 1:30pm about a week before we ate there. This was a good idea because when we arrived it filled to the brink.  When I first arrived, only part of the group was there but they let us get seated before the whole group, what a nice privilege! The decor of abc kitchen was unique and chic (I think that's how you use that word).  The flowers on each table were new daily and it was the little things like that which sets this restaurant apart from your average lunch/dinner spot; the details.  What I ordered was: Butternut Squash soup, Seared Salmon on a bibb salad, and seasonal cookie plate. While we waited for our order, they brought out a sourdough bread which was cold (I am not sure why it was not toasted or put in an oven) and oil. It was actually find of funny, he poured the oil in a little plate and waiter was even impressed with his pour! The food:Butternut Squash Soup: absolutely incredible.  The actual temp of the soup was probably 10 degrees too hot so I needed to wait for it to cool down but I couldn't stop myself, I burnt my tongue twice! The sea salt with whatever nut combined with the creme fraiche (dollop of sour cream) was just a combination I was not mentally prepared for.  I am not sure it would fill me up but if I could, I would want to eat this soup weekly till I was put 6 feet underground.Seared Salmon with bibb salad: Easily the best salmon I have ever had in my 22 years on this earth. I got my cooked medium well which meant that it was fully cooked in the middle but before they served it, they put it on a stove of oil and made it crunchy which unbelievable. Then it comes to the bibb salad (that means that they take giant leaves of lettuce and that is the green part) with cut avocado in tiny pieces with thinly sliced carrots and radishes.  The dressing had kick but also sweet. The combination of salad with the salmon was too much for me. I could not handle the flavors, it was TOO good! When I asked my friends about it, we each thought we could eat this piece of salmon with the dressing every day till we died; what a piece of salmon! Cookie Plate: pretty average. You got a chocolate chip, shortbread with apricot in the middle, sugar cookie and some weird one with a jam in it.  I will say, you can see the picture of the Lemon tart and I think that dessert was the best! Something about lemon tart with a nice crust that makes my mouth water! Overall: The abc restaurants are incredible and during restaurant week they are a steal for the quality and the service! They changed our plates and sliverware between courses which I was impressed by! The type of plates were different for all of us and that was the final touch to a wonderful meal! (Claps his hands to the whole crew)!"
Joel S.,"New York, NY",9/22/2018,4 star rating,"Met up with two other couples at ABC kitchen for dinner.  The space is big, dark and interesting.  It's a bit loud, but the loudness helps isolate people in this festive space.  The waitstaff were uniformly excellent (and attractive).  We started off with some really good bread and olive oil.  Cocktails were on point, though my martini was brought on the rocks instead of up.  They're poured tableside, which I really like.  My main complaint about ABC Kitchen is the rapaciously priced wine list.  Even the obscure wines are expensive.  It's a challenge to find a good bottle of wine for under $100.  IMHO, every restaurant should offer a reasonable bottle of wine for $50 or $60 and let people who want to splurge do so.Rant over- on to the food.  The famous carrot salad was delicious.  The crab toast was very good, but mayonnaise heavy.  The fried calamari was perfectly cooked.  We split a bacon and clam pizza as an appetizer.  Unless you're a rabbi, how can you improve on this?  The crust was light, but firm and chewy.  Main courses were all well received.  The salmon was delicious. I had the monkfish which was excellent, but the portion was small.  Everybody who ordered a healthy entree were drooling over the diner who ordered the burger. He dropped out of the dinner conversation in order to concentrate fully on scarfing it down.  I know that Pete Wells is down on sundaes as desserts because they're a cop out, but I highly recommend the excellent one served here.  It's salted caramel ice cream, fudge, nuts, caramel and a bit of whipped cream.  Just typing that made me smile.Great restaurant, but not perfect- 4.5 stars.  A festive place to have a really good meal."
Marissa C.,"New York, NY",1/30/2018,3 star rating,"Been here a few times, have always had a lovely experience. Tonight, I found a piece of metal in my salad. Photo attached. In fairness this is the second time this has happened to me, so its quite possible, someone has it out for me :)The waiter told the manager and the manager ordered me another salad before addressing the issue. I really didn't want another salad, but it was a nice gesture. Surprised to experience this in such a highly rated restaurant, but I guess it could happen anywhere."
Brian L.,"Queens, NY",11/7/2015,4 star rating,"Beautiful place and vibe. If you're here for brunch, prepare for a bit of a wait. The food was just okay but I probably ordered all the wrong things. Crab toast was excellent. I can't say it doesn't taste like crab meat out of a can but they dress it up nicely. The cured meat and cheese plate was only okay. Weren't the best selections compared to other spreads I had.The smoked salmon with creme fraiche was a mistake. It sucked. Sucked really bad and a waste of money. Eggs Benedict was eggs Benedict. Didn't separate itself from a regular diner. Pricey for this meal. Not worth it."
Rits M.,"Manhattan, NY",11/30/2015,5 star rating,"I came here for brunch with friends for my bday. One of my friends remarked this place looks like Pinterest on steroids and she's not wrong. It's well laid out, lots of small flower arrangements on tables and interesting black and white landscape and nature decor. Lovely wood tables and lamps as well. The food was very tasty and well made but no real explorations with it. I will say that the flavours of the ingredients were well chosen and mixed though. I had the French toast with vanilla soaked cherries and the egg Benedict as well as the almond cake. Very solid brunch option and I love next door as well so will take a stroll when I come back"
Mahsa T.,"New York, NY",10/25/2015,5 star rating,"ABC Kitchen oozes ambiance. The minute you step inside, you will melt into the rustic elegance. This place is BIG! I think it's a block long, we came in one door and I think the back door let out to a different street, there's also an eclectic furniture store attached. As I mentioned, the decor is rustic, the white tables and chairs French country, the lighting romantic, the food solid, the wine divine. Oh the lighting is magical...even more so after two glasses of wine...bare light bulbs hanging from the ceiling...candles on the tables. Bring your date here, bring your girlfriends here, have your next big event here (fantastic venue space!)...but do make reservations! We came in right at 5:30 when they open and snagged a walk-in table. Reservations here are hard to come by and need to be made well in advance.Now the wine...I had the most delightful cabernet sauvignon here. I loved it so much I searched online until I found the only wine/liquor store in Manhattan that sells it. The only underwhelming part of my experience at ABC was the food. I ordered the sea bass, which was disappointingly small for the price. It was well cooked but swimming in a bowl of bland broth. I tried pieces from my friend's charcuterie board and was equally unimpressed. Maybe we ordered wrong. If I were to rate the food only, I'd give it 4 stars (being generous). The dessert, however, saved the day! You MUST get the sundae with salted caramel ice cream, candied peanuts & popcorn, whipped cream and chocolate sauce. Don't leave without ordering this, it's what they do right. Service was satisfactory, though distant, not overly friendly or warm. Very pricey. Two glasses of wine, one entree and one dessert set me back $100. The cozy, dreamy ambiance makes it worthwhile though."
Andrew L.,"Chicago, IL",8/5/2018,5 star rating,"We came here for dinner Saturday night, place was packed. We had a reservation, would recommend.The place looks like it should be on Pinterest. It probably is. Sometimes places with very trendy aesthetics don't actually have great food. That was not the issue here. The pretzel dusted calamari was very tender. I didn't think pretzel dusting added much to it, but fried squid is delicious so I wasn't upset about it.I, like most basic white girls, must have my carbs. We ordered two pastas, and two pizzas. We got the ricotta ravioli since our waiter described them as ""little pockets of joy"". He wasn't wrong. We also got the fettuccine. My god those noodles were good. They were the perfect thickness and texture. Soaked up the pesto sauce really well. I think this pasta was easily top 3 pastas of my life.The thin pizzas were also very tasty. Structurally didn't hold up super well but was still good. I actually really enjoyed the crust of these pizzas too. They killed it with the carbs here.We also had the Black Sea bass. I think that the quality of the fish, and the technique it was prepared with was superb. It was so tender and just melted in your mouth. I do think that the sauce with it was that flavorful. It might have been intentionally more mild, but I'm not a mild man.No true dining experience is complete without dessert. If you disagree, that's fine. You're just wrong and I hate you. We had a slice of the s'mores chocolate cake. Loved the toasted marshmallow on it because it's toasted marshmallow. Great way to end the meal."
Melinda M.,"Oldsmar, FL",10/14/2017,3 star rating,"This one was at the top of our hit list for NYC this time around because we kept seeing articles/lists pop up in my FB timeline. Yelp reviews seemed positive so we decided to give it a try. The exterior was very plain and you wouldn't even know it's there if you didn't look for it. The interior, however was very hip and nicely appointed.We were all excited for this meal and have been looking forward to it so we wanted to order a little bit of everything. When the food came out we couldn't wait to dig in. The plates were plated so beautifully, however, the flavors didn't match up. One of them was too greasy to even finish. None of the plates really stood out. Quite a disappointment. Service was a letdown too. Our server seemed either too busy or uninterested in coming to check on our table. We had to wave her down several times. I would say this is a great place to go and do some people watching, but not to have the best meal you would expect after reading all the other reviews."
Elei Z.,"New York, NY",5/6/2018,4 star rating,"Food good, service terrible. The place is big and can get crowded and noisy, so it gets loud. The tables are pretty tightly packed together, but hey, it's new york. The service is way too slow. They need to be more productive and efficient. Or maybe the problem is too few staff. I don't know. But as a customer, I was continually frustrated by the super slow and inattentive service.One time, I ordered the lobster & egg. And then they brought out a completely different dish because they didn't have the lobster dish anymore. The problem was they didn't let me know. Instead they charged me for an egg dish I never meant to order. They should've let me know beforehand so that I could've replaced it with something else or just cancelled the dish. They often made mistakes with our drinks. Got the wrong drink at lunch, asked for the right drink and it just never came. A different time for dinner, a similar situation happened - we got the wrong drinks and we also randomly got drinks we never ordered...  they really need to step it up. It's a pity because I like the food but just can't stand the service. The food's always delightful - doesn't seem to matter what you get off the menu,. For brunch, I especially enjoyed the calamari. The sauce was  sweet and the calamari was light and crispy. Many times when I get calamari (at various places), it always comes too oily and either too soft or too hard. The pieces are usually too large and not sufficiently bite sized. And the calamari is often times too chewy. But at ABC Kitchen, it was delicate but with a satisfying crunch. The french toast was also very good. Very fluffy and egg-y and soft. I thought it was a little too sweet though. But overall, great french toast. The egg looks pretty plain - after all, it's just egg. But it was so good. Every bite was a burst of flavor."
Kirsten S.,"Gilbert, AZ",1/16/2020,4 star rating,"Tucked away and unassuming but very spacious and too quaint and cute for words. Came in for a group of six at lunchtime on Monday and they were super accommodating and friendly staff. We had the mushroom pizza which if you love mushrooms, this is a must have. Also had the calamari which was good but the sauce stole the show. Great for business lunch or would be sweet spot for brunch."
Farhana S.,"Los Angeles, CA",10/11/2015,4 star rating,"Finally had the chance to try 3 Michelin Star Chef Jean Georges's ABC Kitchen. Don't be surprised if you happen to pass by looking for this spot a few times while in the area! The low key outdoor appearance can be deceiving...my advice? Make reservations or else your sure to have to wait at least 1 1/2hrs.I was so excited to try this place and moreover the signature courses. A bit disappointed that it did not live up to expectations, but surely worth a try. Started the night off with the crab toast. Super fresh and delicious with a kick. Only wish the bread wasn't as burnt...definitely get your own! 4/5 Second course, husband and I shared the Farm fresh wild mushroom pizza. Pretty good as you can taste the delicious mushrooms, cheese and egg. A bit of a struggle being able to cut thru it though and definitely not the best crust I've had. I'd have to give it a 3/5Final course we shared the Organic Fried Chicken in Hot Butter Sauce. Wow! Explosion of flavors! Definitely have not tried anything like this before. To start off very impressed they already split the dish in half for us in separate plates. The chicken is not greasy at all, but instead super moist, crisp and delicious! Must order!! The sauce was interesting, and the greens...wish I had a better knife to cut thru them more easily. Overall I'd give this dish a 4.5/5 I'd give this place a try, definitely for the crab toast and organic fried chicken at least. Service was great as well. Not sure if it's a spot I'd die to come back again, but worth a try for the newbies!"
Adrienne G.,"San Francisco, CA",9/15/2015,5 star rating,"Fantastic Saturday Brunch - got a rezzie ( you'll want to do the same ) & when we arrived, the place was packedReminded the Mr & me of Angelina in Paris w/ the large, open, airy dining room & fancy furniture, but we were lucky enough to sit right outside that area in a quaint patio-like spot, complete w/ trees & led lightsAt a loss for what to order, our server helped the Mr narrow down his choice to the Mushroom Breakfast Pizza & he couldn't have been more impressed.  A TON of shrooms & nice runny egg, all sitting on top of a chewy & toothsome crust.  He was in heaven!I opted for the Peach Vanilla-Bean French Toast & it was totally custardy & saturated in this lovely vanilla-bean simple syrup and unbelievably coated with this crusty, almost brulee-like cinnamon-coating.  Paired w/ the poached peach?  OMG DELISH!And thanks to our lovely server, we started our whole adventure w/ a scrumptious Heirloom Tomato Toast - delish, simple ingredients of thick grainy bread & thinly sliced tomatoes drizzled w/ olive oil - genius!Spiciest Bloody for the Mr ( which he said ties w/ his alltime fav Bloody from Sam's in Tiburon )..... & even I, who am not a fan of Bloodies ( except for Sam's ) thought this was fantastic!  I opted for their Peach Wine Cooler & it was refreshing & fruity & the perfect pairing to each of our mealsService was over the top nice & this was the first time I've *ever* included a note on our bill......but we just had to thank them for the fantastic service & wonderful brunch experienceWe'll be seeing yall again at our next NYC getaway!!"
Judy L.,"Manhattan, NY",10/11/2015,3 star rating,"This review is for their cocktail only. Stopped by for a nice cocktail after walking the city, ambiance is very relaxing, chic with little bit of rustic wood works thought out, but with white and flowers and crystals, perfect for a date or GNO. Cocktails were expensive side at $16 but was not very good. Seems like Yelp doesn't have a lot of pix on the drinks so will put up some we had. We had apple mimosa and the lemonade drink."
Megha M.,"San Francisco, CA",11/9/2017,4 star rating,"3.5 stars 5 stars for the ambiance but 3 stars for food. When I walked in, I felt rich and pretty. It's a beautiful layout and when you step inside you forget you're in the middle of a crazy city. My friend and I did the prix fixe lunch, and for $30ish it was good for the price. But, I definitely expected the food to be way way better. The butternut squash soup was good. I think out of all the dishes, this was my favorite. It was creamy and flavorful but not too dense. But it was lukewarm and I don't like lukewarm soup. My friend ordered the roasted beets with yogurt, and that was pretty good, but nothing to rave about. For the main course I ordered the angel hair pasta. That was quite mediocre. It was really oily and had no flavor. Like not even salt. I asked for some crushed red pepper and 20 minutes later, I did get it, but by that time I kind of ate enough of the bland pasta and I remained unimpressed. My friend ordered the salmon though, and said it was delicious. For dessert I got the salted caramel sundae, which was yummy but it was huge. It was for like 4 people. I felt so bad about wasting it! My friend ordered the almond cake, and that was amazing. I should've ordered that instead. Overall though, the portions of each course were huge. For a 3 course meal, I feel like you should make the portions a bit smaller so that you can eat everything?? But I guess that's good in a way. We did take home all the leftovers.I definitely recommend making a reservation. When the restaurant opened up at 12pm on a Tuesday, it was packed by 12:30. I would go back because I did enjoy the experience, but maybe I'd try something off the prix fixe menu"
Lisaveta C.,"Los Angeles, CA",11/30/2019,5 star rating,"If I could give this place six stars, I would. The ambiance, the food, the service... everything was excellent. We got white truffle stracciatella which was on special. It melted in our mouths. Then we had tuna sashimi which was good and fettuccini with Brussel sprouts and pesto was so delicious as well. Overall, this place is amazing. Definitely coming back when I'm in NYC"
Trisha P.,"New York, NY",2/18/2018,4 star rating,The food here is amazing. Every dish that we got was delicious and very inventive flavors. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful. However the only reason for giving it four stars was because the service was EXTREMELY slow. It took forever for our food to come out between courses and it was odd because everyone else around us was finishing their dinner a lot faster than us. The food was very good but I had to take a star off for the service.
Rachel H.,"La Quinta, CA",6/18/2019,3 star rating,"We celebrated my 50th Birthday here last week. Our experience was not what we had hoped. During our visit, for ambiance ABC Kitchen deserves 4 stars. For food, 4 stars. For service, 2 stars. We were seated and placed our drink order. We then didn't see our server for what felt like forever. Drink arrived, it was a nice martini. Our server eventually came to take our order, and our appetizer, the tuna sashimi arrived very quickly (brought to us by someone other than our server). It was delicious. Entrees came out soon thereafter but our sides did not. We tried to find our server, but could not so we dug into our entrees. My husband had the fried chicken which was very good and I had the bolognese over strozzapreti, which was tasty but the shape and cut of the pasta made it very awkward to eat. I finally was able to literally flag down the server to ask about the sides, she apologized and said she would get them. Another 10 minutes or so pass, and as she stopped by the table next to us to take their order, she mentioned that our sides were ""coming out now"". They didn't. At least another 10 minutes later, when we were then finished with our entrees, out came the sides. The server never came by the table again during the meal, someone else took our dessert order and brought it to us. The server did bring us the check and here's where things really went off the rail. As I was writing up the tip and and signing the check, she decided to clear our table of the remaining glasses and side plates! Literally hovering over us in an obtrusive way as I wrote up the check (I still gave her over 20%) and clearing things. So, now that we are ready to leave she can finally pay attention to our table? My husband is about as easy going as they come, and he was livid. Her service issues were not just limited to us, the table next to us ordered a bottle of pinot and she brought out two champagne glasses and dropped them and left, then returned quite a while later with a bottle of champagne. They just looked at her like WHAT THE??? The older gentleman had to explain that it was pinot not champagne. It then took a considerable amount of time for her to return with the wine, and they were finished with their entrees. None of this is the end of the world, but we chose ABC for my big milestone birthday because of its reputation. We figured it would be a sure thing. Were it not for the terrible service, it would have been a lovely evening."
Masha B.,"Brooklyn, NY",6/7/2019,4 star rating,"Came here because a wait to Sugarfish was 2 hours...and I was starving. I've had ABC Kitchen on my list for some time so when my friend suggested we check it out - i was more than happy to do so! We were able to get seated at the bar in the back and as we weaved our way through the restaurant towards our seat I 1) realized how cozy and charming this restaurant is and 2) this is literally the perfect restaurant for a date. On to the food - since it's been hot and humid in nyc lately, i haven't been craving heavier dishes/meat so i opted for fish. I generally prefer fish such as salmon, arctic char, but opted for the Black Sea Bass. It was good but i honestly expected more! My friend got the line caught tuna sashimi marinated with ginger and mint and that was super fresh and delicious! The cocktail i got was the ginger margarita and do not think the price ($18) justified the taste. Nothing groundbreaking here. Would probably opt for a glass of wine next time. I definitely will be back to try more things off the menu!"
Kiara D.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",8/18/2018,4 star rating,"This restaurant is huge and amazing!I was impressed by the decor and the fact that it connects to Abc cocina where i got a sangria as i was waiting for my table.Our table was super cool, industrial!I was expecting a little more from food since i've heard very good things abiut this place.We ordered the homemade cavatelli with ricotta, eggplant and cherry tomato.It tasted delicious but unfortunately the pasta was overcooked.Cheese basil pizza was nothing special, the dough was ok.I'd like to go back and try more dishes, hopefully they'll make it up!!!"
Patrick N.,"Los Angeles, CA",9/29/2019,4 star rating,"So as it turns out, Jean Georges Vongerichten (the top chef honcho at ABC Kitchen) is not Joel Robuchon, who features legendary mashed potato sides at every one of his restaurants. I was first in the city from a long flight, end of the day, and in the moment I had mixed up the two in my head. That said, the mashed potatoes side at ABC Kitchen were very good, as they were just as creamy and buttery as you'd want in any excellent version. While I have no shame in admitting that I have in the past eaten only potatoes as a meal, I was fortunate enough to have more than that here. The charcuterie and cheese plate is exactly what you'd want it to be if you ordered it. And the sea bass dish was perfect, with a surprising drops of diced, candied or preserved lemon of some kind. The dish was outstanding. The only downside was this bread that they served, which was dry and didn't have a great flavor. The service was all perfect and kind, so points for that!I overall enjoyed ABC Kitchen and would definitely return next time I'm in New York!"
Cyn K.,"Evergreen, CO",1/14/2020,5 star rating,We had a really nice and yummy dinner. Started with the Pretzel Dusted Calamari and it was served with both a catsup and mustard aioli that was a great compliment. For the main we had the cod and sea bass. Both were cooked perfectly and accompanied with fresh vegis with herbs.   We finished by sharing the chocolate cake with marshmallow frosting and little chocolate crispy balls. It was a fun twist on chocolate cake. It's a great atmosphere for date night too.
Harrison E.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",8/18/2019,5 star rating,"Went for brunch, got the turkey and bacon. The sandwich was delicious. The bread and the herb mayo they used accentuated the already superb organic ingredients. I will definitely be back again."

Elina S.,"Chicago, IL",9/26/2017,4 star rating,"Definitely one of my more memorable dinner experiences in NYC. This place was just beautiful, absolutely a stunning atmosphere. We came here on a Friday evening and it was packed, lots of people for date night, friends enjoying Friday night drinks, families out for celebratory dinners, just a beautiful place to be at. Our server was very attentive and we started out with the crab toast, which everyone seems to talk about. I did love the crab but our actual was a little on the burnt side which I didn't love. We then shared one of their amazing pizzas with a million mushrooms, it was definitely on the unique side and we enjoyed that. Then as stuffed as we were after drinks and appetizers, I knew we needed to get some dessert and something told me to get their chocolate cake. Honestly I didn't love it and I wish we had the popcorn sundae dessert instead because that's the dessert to get here apparently. ABC Kitchen your atmosphere impressed me the most and I would definitely recommend this place on any NYC weekend."
Kenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",8/20/2015,5 star rating,"1800 Yelpers can't be wrong, right?ABC Kitchen is a treat. I came here to celebrate my birthday and I can tell you that all the positive reviews are right on the mark. The atmosphere is amazing. We sat in the back room that connects ABC Kitchen, Cocina and the ABC Home. There was this tree structure reaching toward the ceiling, a rustic chandelier, and many strings of light leading to the upstairs of ABC Home. Lovely all around.Our waiter was great, and spot on with most of his recommendations.For starters, we had the famed crab toast with lemon aioli. It was a slice of rye cut in four with generous heapings of crab chunks on top. I can definitely understand the hype.Next, we had the shaved raw fluke with crushed ollives, dill and chillies. The fluke itself was okay, but combining all the sauces and flavors really made the whole better than the sum of its parts. Nice saltiness and spiciness.For mains, we shared two. The roasted halibut and the crispy pork confit. They split the pork confit across two plates, which was nice. I still think about that pork dish from time to time, like a forlorn lover. The skin on the pork was incredibly crispy, the bacon marmalade added a smoky and sweet flavor, and the braised turnips were actuall from root all the way to stem.The halibut, however, was just okay. It was served over crushed tomatoes, and had julienned squash. The best part was probably the fresh basil, but at $34, I'd skip it.For cocktails, I had the Vermont gold vodka thyme lemonade, which tasted like summer. Nice and refreshing.Reservations are hard to come by (at least at a reasonable time), so definitely plan ahead! Like... a month ahead."
Irene C.,"Detroit, MI",1/2/2018,4 star rating,"What a cute restaurant.  We walked in around 2:00 PM and this place was completely packed.  I didn't make a reservation since we decided to go at the last minute so we waited about 20 minutes.  The host seemed very overwhelmed at the amount of people who were waiting--I'd probably be overwhelmed too.  I was surprised by the amount of people who were in here.Roasted Carrot and Avocado Salad - the carrots were soft and full of flavor; this was a good salad.Black Sea Bass - the fish was just okay.  If I went back I'd get something else.  The best part of this dish was the spinach which had jalapeno in it.Sea Salt Caramel Sundae - I'll admit the main reason I came was after seeing the pictures of the sundae.  The portion was gigantic compared to the size of the entree and appetizer.  It was totally unexpected.  The sundae did not disappoint.Even though I didn't enjoy the sea bass that much, I'm convinced that nothing here is bad.  I would come back to try the rest of the menu.  I really like that they are environmentally conscious and they have a seasonal menu."
Magdalena S.,"Manhattan, NY",1/24/2020,2 star rating,"Lovely ambiance, meh food. I've dined here four or five times. The food is generally over-salted and over done. Herbs are wilted and browned in the fish dishes, as if you were ordering soup. Food tastes like an okay cooking attempt at home. Then the check comes... surprise, you're paying twice as much as you think this food is worth. Wish Bohemian had an opening.Props to the cauliflower soup though. That was good."
Laurie W.,"San Francisco, CA",7/26/2015,3 star rating,"Came here on my birthday after a gazillion of tries to get a reservation!The place is beautifully casual, low lights and open space.  Really nice...love!Me and my significant other ordered Crab toastPretzel dusted calamariAkaushi cheeseburger (for me!)Pork confit (for him)The crab toast - fresh, delicious and i like the hint of saltiness from the water.  It was a bit crabby for me but i like it nonetheless.  I think it was mainly all the mixture of texture, the crunch of toast, the soft crab meat...yum!The calamari - nothing fancy...i expected a bit more...like the taste of pretzel but they were like regular calamaris to me.The cheeseburger - delicious!  they loaded you up with all the pickles!  and the mayo helped cut the meat The pork confit - very saucy and flavorful...too much maybe going on but very tender!Im not sure if i'll come back though...it didnt live up to the hype"

Anna K.,"Washington, DC",7/7/2017,5 star rating,"Delicious food, and a killer vibe -- Jean-Georges does it again with ABC Kitchen.Located in the Flatiron District, ABC Kitchen is famed Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten's answer to locally-sourced, organic cuisine. The trendy, yet casually-chic venue (located inside ABC Carpet & Home) makes for the perfect setting to enjoy some of the best food in NYC.My boyfriend and I went to ABC Kitchen on a Friday night for his birthday dinner. I had made reservations well in advance, and we were seated promptly upon our arrival at 8 PM. Although I had requested a quiet table (thanks to the advice from other Yelp reviews), it wasn't particularly quiet. Still--the loud noise is just part of ABC Kitchen's vibe, and we proceeded to make the best of the situation.While the restaurant was beautifully decorated, and the service was pleasant (we had no complaints about our waitress or service whatsoever); the real star of ABC Kitchen is simple: it's the food. Because SO many menu items sounded and looked SO good (some of those pictures on Yelp are just drool-worthy!), we opted to share a few dishes, instead of just ordering our own. More specifically, we started with the 'Roasted Beets with Housemade Yogurt', continued with the 'Mushrooms, Parmesan, Oregano and Farm egg Whole Wheat Pizza', and then moved on to the 'Black Sea Bass with Chilies and Herbs, Baby Market Potatoes and Spinach.' Finally, after a little birthday cupcake, we concluded the night by sharing the famous 'Sundae with Salted Caramel Ice Cream, Candied Peanuts & Popcorn, Whipped Cream, Hot Fudge.' Everything was just AMAZING -- it was one of the best meals I've ever had in NYC -- and I don't think I'll ever stop dreaming about that Mushroom Pizza! :) In addition to dinner, ABC Kitchen also serves lunch, and brunch on the weekends. While I have yet to experience those meals, I have no doubt they're FANTASTIC, as well.The restaurant's been a hot spot for 7+ years, and it's still going strong. Reservations can be difficult to get on short notice (especially for weekend nights) -- so if you want to ensure you can get a table at a good time, go ahead and plan your trip to ABC Kitchen well in advance. Trust me, you WILL NOT regret it! The only REAL issue is making the plan to return to ABC Kitchen, once again! :)"
Christina G.,"New York, NY",2/25/2018,5 star rating,"Celebrated my 30th birthday here with my boyfriend on 2/23. I have been wanting to get to this restaurant for years. We somehow were able to score a reservation at 9PM on a Friday night which was so surprising. from the ambiance to the food - everything was extraordinary. It certainly lives up the hype. I see some reviews mention the service being slow, we had no issues. Our waiter was super attentive and on point. He even offered tons of info on the beers that they had on tap. He was super friendly and accommodating.For starters we got the crab toast, pizza and pretzel calamari. All excellent and tasty. As entrees, I got the black sea bass with spinach - super fresh and wonderfully seasoned. My boyfriend got the chicken with spicy butter and collard greens which was great also.For dessert they gave me an adorable cupcake with a happy birthday plate on the house as well as our order of cake and ice cream. Even the cappuccinos were delicious.Most certainly will be back. Thanks for an awesome birthday dining experience."
Scarlett F.,"New York, NY",7/25/2019,3 star rating,"I want to like this place but it's not letting me. I had a reservation for two, my friend arrived a few minutes early but was not allowed to be seated. Food was barely satisfactory, my salad appetizer was way over salted I didn't even finish, the main course salmon was slight better. The cake was very firm and too sweet. I left very hungry. Also I wasn't very fond of the decor here, a rusty pipe was right above my head, not sure if it was done on purpose or what. Overall I'm rather disappointed given this is one of Jean Georges' restaurants."
Ms F.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",10/24/2019,3 star rating,"Overrated for sure. Get the crab toast. It's just like Luke's Lobster's crab roll. Their pizzas are really heavy but good. However, their crust is burnt sometimes..."
R K.,"New York, NY",7/19/2021,1 star rating,"Super disappointed in a Monday night dinner at a restaurant we used to love. Cocktails were great but the food was pretty bad. Almost everything we ordered was oversalted but otherwise tasteless.  Listless, greasy fried chicken and a pretty dull version of the restaurant's well-known carrot and avocado salad were two of the misfires. When we mentioned the cook's overly heavy hand with salt to our waitress she shared that we weren't the first that evening to report similar sentiment."
Brandon E.,"Providence, RI",6/26/2019,4 star rating,"It was very good - but nothing jumps out from the brunch we had. We sampled most of the options and there were yummy, but tbh, was expecting this to earn the 5th star and just didn't seem to get there in my (overly critical) book. Still worth a visit or two nonetheless!"
Archana R.,"San Jose, CA",11/16/2017,5 star rating,"Do not think I'd love it as much as I did! Being a vegetarian, I didn't see very many options on their menu that could cater, and even asked if they could make something off the menu. Though they weren't able to make something off the menu, they were willing to modify items to make them vegetarian. If you are going off the Yelp reviews, PLEASE don't believe that this place is for vegetarians. There were I believe 4 entree dishes that were vegetarian. Regardless, the dish I got was perfect! It was hard to tell portion size tho as their menu lists an appetizer price and an entree price. We ordered the Ricotta and Fig compote and marinated olives as the appetizer, as well as the roast carrot and avocado salad. For main course, we had the angel hair with jalapeño and garlic butter sauce topped with ricotta, pizza, and the crispy pork confit. We ended our delicious meals with an order of creme brûlée and the Concord grape tart.I ordered the pasta and the uniqueness of it was delightful! The added charm to this pasta was the saffron!"
Eric H.,"New York, NY",4/13/2018,5 star rating,"This place gets pretty busy so make sure to make a reservation. The food was really good, I loved the grilled lobster I had for lunch. Great lighting and excellent service. Looking for a quality meal, come here!"
Dorothy T.,"Santa Monica, CA",6/2/2018,5 star rating,"ABC Kitchen was amazing! The fried chicken and extra side of mashed potatoes were absolutely epic. The skin on the juicy fried chicken was crazy crispy and thin, and the collard greens it came with was super flavorful, thanks to the hot buttered sauce in the dish. The mashed potatoes were the creamiest, most decadent mashed I have ever had. I will definitely be back just for these two dishes!We also had the whipped ricotta, green pea soup, and pesto pasta. The pasta was also fantastic, and the whipped ricotta was perfectly buttery.We also tried three desserts - the hot fudge sundae, almond cake, and chocolate Creme brûlée. The desserts were good, but not magical like the entrees."
Steven K.,"San Francisco, CA",7/29/2019,5 star rating,ABC DEF meets all the hype and surpasses your snobby expectations.  A relaxed setting with good food and drink is ideal for any occasion.  A relaxed setting that surprises you with how good the food is while drinking good alcohol makes for an exceptional experience.
Sarah B.,"New York, NY",12/1/2019,5 star rating,"Went back last week for brunch on Saturday, absolutely exquisite from soup, to french toast! A pure delish !Gréât service and amis ce as well !"
Whitney P.,"Manhattan, NY",2/9/2018,5 star rating,"I really have zero bad thing to say. Abc Kitchen was phenomenal. I came with a girlfriend of mine for the restaurant week prefix menu. Apparently we have similar taste buds because we picked the exact same meal. We had the butternut squash soup, salmon, and chocolate cake for dessert. The soup was amazing. I'm not a fav of butternut squash when it's served too sweet, this was not at all. It was savory, and the crunchy pumpkin seeds were such a nice touch. The salmon was cooked to perfection, and the dill sauce, radishes, and cucumbers were so complimentary. I LOVED the salmon, still thinking about it!And the chocolate cake was pure heaven. I typically don't gravitate toward chocolate because it can be too rich for my taste, but this was so so so good. I couldn't finish the piece, but I wanted to! It was so soft and moist (sorry moist haters) and the marshmallows and mini malt balls were so yummy. To top it off, the atmosphere is gorgeous. The wait staff were lovely and very attentive. We had such a wonderful lunch and I can't wait to come back and bring my husband."
Melanie C.,"New York, NY",12/31/2017,5 star rating,"Hands down the BEST ricotta lemon pancakes in town. My friend's spaghetti was so delicious she almost ordered a second to go (although Barry's Bootcamp will do that to ya). Stick with the classic drinks, because my friend's cocktail tasted like medicine, but the mimosas had a good champagne to OJ ratio.Ambience was gorgeous, and it's a large place so there's room to move around and wait. Chic but casual, definitely Insta-worthy, and ideal for a girls' brunch."
Chelsea H.,"San Francisco, CA",6/6/2018,4 star rating,"I came here for a work event/celebration so we had a group of 18 or so. They gave us a custom preset menu. The appetizers to begin with were delicious. My favorite was the crab toast! I wish there was more, but I'll definitely be back to eat it again. All the entrees were tasty, but hard to share since they would give one entree to share between 4-5 people so we would have to figure a way to divide a sandwich and burger. Last, but not least the salted caramel popcorn ice cream was a nice sweet savory flavor and the popcorn added a perfect crunch texture. Will be back for that too!"
Sam C.,"Albertson, NY",6/9/2021,2 star rating,"ABC Kitchen is an NYC classic. I remember not being able to secure a reservation here pre-covid. We ended up being able to make a reservation rather easily. The service was very slow, it took a while for us to get seated, and then a while for the food to be ordered. We got the mushroom pizza, burger & fish of the day. Food was great, I have no complaints about that whatsoever. Everything was cooked well and was delicious. If they can work on the service, that would be my only two cents."
Theresa W.,"Washington, DC",5/12/2017,4 star rating,"Wow I don't usually care that much about a restaurant's decor, but this place is so pretty and magical fairy land inside with sweet little flower and nature touches and gorgeous old fashioned flowered china.My friend and I made reservations for brunch a couple of weeks out and when were arrived were seated promptly. We both had the eggs Benedict, which were excellent, with lots of generous ham and a small portion of large cut home fries on the side. They have an interesting menu of brunch cocktails and a variety of sodas made in house. I had to try the apple ginger, which was a not-too-sweet fizzy delight. My friend's Paloma was well made and was rimmed with lavender salt, which was a fun touch. I didn't see coffee on the menu, but they have both regular and decaf, which were excellent and served in old fashioned real silver services, and were $4 each. For dessert, the cookie plate really caught my eye, especially the rose sugar cookie since I love anything rose flavored. Sadly, it tasted just like a regular sugar cookie with no rose flavor whatsoever. But, the rest of the treats were great. I especially liked the mallomar and the lemon cookie. Be sure to wander through the restaurant into the store portion, called ABC Home. It's multiple stories and sells all the expensive, grown up Anthrolopologie-esque furniture and housewares you could ever want."
Mary F.,"Arlington, VA",3/14/2019,1 star rating,"This was one of the most disappointing dining experiences I've had in a very long time. My parents had been wanting me to try this place for a long time and as they'd been before and loved it. I was visiting for the weekend and we decided to go.We made reservation for Saturday brunch and arrived a little before our reservation time. There was about a 10 minute wait for the table which is common and responsible. The restaurant is wonderfully decorated and has a good ambiance. That's where the good things stop.Once we are sat at our table in the main dining room, we were not brought water or menus until we had been at our table for 15 minutes. We FINALLY received menus and water only to be ignored for another 10 minutes.At this point we had been at our table for 25 minutes and had not been able to order anything, even drinks. We weren't even sure if we had a server. After many attempts, I finally managed to flag down some poor employee and begged for some bread and someone to come take our order. He disappears and comes back with bread and the bartender who promptly asked us what we wanted. We were not sat anywhere close to the bar area so I'm still confused how he was the only person available to take a order.Out food comes out within a responsible amount of time and is bland and lukewarm. The only item we liked was the pretzel coated calamari. The eggs on the eggs Benedict were all massively over cooked. Everything lacked flavor. Nothing was hot. No server at any point checked on us. The only employees we interacted with were the food runners and the water-guys. Getting our check was another 15 minute process of trying to flag someone down. We never figured out who our server was.The final ""cherry"" on top was when someone (who maybe was the manager?) came over while we were paying to ask how our meal was. We answered ""not good"". Her response was ""oh"" before walking away. I'm not sure why she even asked. No one apologized to us at any point. For a restaurant with such a good reputation I expected a lot better. We will not be back."
Yulu H.,"New York, NY",3/3/2018,3 star rating,Love the decor and service. Food was okay. Very little portion and on the pricey side. We ordered pizza and pasta. Pizza was a little too dry/overheated. Pasta were good.
Syyu C.,"San Francisco, CA",4/12/2017,5 star rating,"Me and a couple of close friends had a ""Girls Weekend"" in NYC and were excited to try ABC Kitchen for brunch! A trendy farm to table restaurant. It was an amazing experience from start to finish. Both the food and décor were phenomenal - ABC Kitchen easily became one of my favorite dining experiences here in New York. The restaurant is beautiful and the menu had a great variety (salads, pizzas, pastas, sandwiches, seafood). Everything we had was amazing - you can't go wrong with any of the choices on the menu. Highly recommend the crab toast for the appetizer, and the salted caramel ice cream for dessert! My friends and I shared - * Crab toast with Lemonaioli ($16) * Mushrooms, parmesan, oregano and farm egg pizza ($22)* Summer squash, feta, caraway, chilies and lemon pizza ($20)* Black sea bass withchilies and herbs,heirloom tomatoes and arugula ($34)* Scrambled eggs with fried oysters * Salted caramel ice cream sundaeEverything was fresh and beautifully presented. The meal was so amazing that I have almost no words to describe it. Make sure you save room for dessert! What's not to love about caramel ice cream topped with hot chocolate, peanuts, caramel popcorn and homemade whipped cream? My roommate even said it was one of the best desserts she's ever had. This is hands down one of the best restaurants in New York! It felt like a gourmet experience - a great place for a special lunch or dinner. After lunch, we walked through connecting floors to the ABC furniture and homewares store - definitely worth checking out!"
Jason T.,"Las Vegas, NV",9/10/2017,4 star rating,"Came here for brunch during our trip to NYC on Labor Day weekend and enjoyed the food, service, and the ambiance.  I was not that hungry so I only ordered Crab Toast and a side of bacon.  The crab toast was delicious.  It was fresh, tangy, and they do not skimp on the crab.   My husband ordered the French toast which was also very delicious.  The cocktails were also on point.  Would definitely go back."
Christina M.,"Staten Island, NY",1/14/2018,5 star rating,"A wonderful night out! The decor is beautiful, excellent service, and the food was delicious. I was also very happy with the pacing of the meal. We ordered two appetizers, which were brought out one at a time. I thought that was nice, because it gave us time to really enjoy what we were eating. Overview over what we ordered: Margarita and Ginger margarita: both very good. Ginger margarita was subtle but had a great kick. Home made ricotta with pear compote: delicious Calamari: tender and served with amazing sauces Fried chicken: flavorful and moist Burger: very tasty and high quality beef. Ice cream Sundae- my favorite thing we ate!! The mix of hot fudge, popcorn, and ice cream was amazing. Chocolate cake-fine, but not as good as ice cream"
Marwan A.,"Grosse Pointe, MI",8/11/2019,5 star rating,"What a place. Nice vibe. Great food. Excellent service. It may be busy with a wait and advance reservation. Well worth it. The food was so delicate and flavorful. Will be on my list for returns. They are vested in the quality of service and food. It shows. In brief, I shared the cured meats and cheese plate and Shaved Fluke which were terrific. After a kale salad I relished the black grouper in herb broth which is probably the neatest and most refined presentation I have had for this flavorful fish. Then off the some amazing ice cream. All dinner paired with some French wines to match. Unusual seating with some lighting; but focused lights always spot your dish and menu very well, and the ambiance every so social.Terrific experience. Go there!!"
Chelsea T.,"Patchogue, NY",9/23/2015,4 star rating,"Atmosphere: very cool. A very diverse crowd that extended to the wait staff. There were a lot of families, couples, friends, etc. Food: the crab toast was very tasty! Some parts of the toast were a little too rough for my liking but plenty of crab on the top! Cheddar biscuits-yum! You don't really need butter or jelly in my opinion they taste good without it (they also charged extra for that). I got the turkey sandwich and it was very good. It was so fresh and everything they put on it came together really well. I got the jalapeño on the side-too hot for me. The fries that came with were good also. They had herbs, garlic and seasoning-yum! My bf absolutely loved the French toast! Looking at yelp pics I wasn't convinced it would be good but it really was delicious. I was also surprised by the portions. Pictures on Yelp definitely seemed like it was less food. I was more than satisfied. I felt like I was going to roll over. Drinks: I got a rum and coke and it was pretty good. Generally, I think their drinks are expensive but what else is new in NYC. Service: pretty quick service. Our waitress was a little strange. If I had to take a guess she is in theater. I'm not sure if our interactions were strange because we couldn't hear each other that well or what- but something was off. Overall it was a cool spot and the food was good. I'd go back!"
Shelly G.,"Philadelphia, PA",2/4/2016,4 star rating,"Came here for restaurant week on a Thursday afternoon. The aura of this place is amazing. It's very casual and relaxed and trendy. Just walking in, I felt it was going to be a nice healthy meal. We did the restaurant week menu and for appetizer I got the lentil soup. I would say it was good and how a lentil soup should be. Main meal I got the raviolo which I must say was amazing! So differnt than anything I have had before and it paired well with the pork and chilies on the bottom. Dessert was amazing as well, I got the salted caramel ice cream which had caramel popcorn and peanuts which was a good pairing and completed the meal very well. I would give 4 stars and definitely recommend people to come here!"
Amy C.,"Irvine, CA",3/20/2017,3 star rating,"My husband and I are visiting from California and wanted to treat ourselves to one fancy dinner. The restaurant itself is well decorated very dimly lit I like the Decor and ambience for people watching. But food wise and service wise it was only so-so. Our waitress was serving a big party of 12 next to us and was very frazzled and didn't pay attention to us so we felt that kind of ruined our experience.Everyone recommended the wild mushroom pizza with the running egg on top, I was really disappointed by the pizza the flavor of the sauce and everything was mediocre at best.I did enjoy the crab toast it was done well very refreshing as an appetizer.  I like the hint of lemon aoli sauceFor the cost of everything I don't think I would come back again."
Suki W.,"New York, NY",1/23/2016,5 star rating,"The ambiance in the restaurant is wonderful. The place is lit with beautiful lights and the fixtures are all beautiful and classy looking. I was extremely lucky to be seated immediately when I stepped in. It turns out that ABC Kitchen is fully reserved for the next two weeks. How popular!My two favorite dishes that I got was the Crab Toast and the Mushroom, Parmesan, Oregano, and Farm Egg Pizza. Oh, I lied. It's three--I love the Salted Caramel Ice Cream Sundae too. Those three dishes are my recommendation for a must try for first time.Oh, and for all my wine people--their Merlot and Chardonnay is wonderful. I need to find out which bottle it is from!Now go try ABC Kitchen!"
Mallory L.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",1/12/2016,5 star rating,The mushroom pizza here is one of the best pizzas I've ever had. The cheddar biscuits are to die for. The crispy potatoes are also excellent. You can't go wrong here!Make a reservation so you can sit in the back. It's so lovely with lights strung everywhere.
Joy G.,"Newton, MA",2/28/2017,5 star rating,"ABC Kitchen is my top ""Sophisticated Adult"" restaurant to go to in New York. You know what I'm talking about. There are some places that are comforting in their casual, no-frills appeal (the Thai place around the block with the best summer rolls, the reliable $1 pizza joint). There are other places that you go with your friends to get silly (the dive bar near your office, the brunch bistro that caters specifically to the mimosa-and-eggs-Benny crowd). And then there are those places like ABC Kitchen where you savor every drop that crosses your plate and you do so in your best stretchy work pants. First, it's absolutely beautiful inside. ABC Kitchen and Gramercy Tavern both have some of the best interiors that I've seen (though, granted, I have not seen much). Second, the food is ""bring your parents here, bring your boss here, bring your in-laws here, bring your client here"" good. Here are the stand-outs:Crab toast. I've broken my no-bread rules for this. Squash toast with ricotta. Not as much of a head-burst as the crab toast but the kabocha squash and ricotta really pair well together. Mushroom, Parmesan, and farm egg pizza. SAY WHAT. Seared salmon. I have yet to try any of the pastas and the roast carrot and avocado salad was kind of basic for $17 but everything else was worth ruminating over several days later. And yes, my list skews more to the carbs side of the food pyramid but as I like to remind myself, you only live once. Chef Jean-Georges, please adopt me! No, seriously."
Dominic D.,"Florham Park, NJ",1/3/2018,4 star rating,Well for the ambiance and decor it's 4 stars! I didn't enjoy my lobster that my friend and I both got all that much and I didn't think it was worth the $45 price tag bc of the size We walked in New Year's Day and it was about to close so I understand not having a table or any open reservations. We decided to sit at the bar and then they came up to us and offered us a table so that was nice. The menu looked fantastic I can't complain about that! Service was solid and I'm sure it was one of the busier brunches of the year so for us showing up so late and then accommodating us helped a lotI'll give it another try but no lobster next time
Melissa D.,"Carmel, IN",3/3/2019,4 star rating,"Fun and great atmosphere. Loved decor and all that the restaurant stands for. The calamari was coated in pretzel crumbs which was very mild tasting but delicious. The crab toast was delicious and unique. Full of flavor and different that the norm of what you ""normally"" get on a menu, it was very light and flavorful. My pasta with bolognese was very good and spicy. So if you don't like spicy then stay clear. The porkchop on the menu was heavenly it was so juicy and tender and the apples added the perfect combo. It was spectacular. Got the shaved brussel spout slaw and it was bland, wouldn't get that again. Our server was super nice, but our service was slow at the same time. Needed to ask for a refill and to have my bread plate cleared after removing everything else. Overall, very minor and would definitely go back."
Teresa T.,"Palisades Park, NJ",8/16/2015,4 star rating,"ABC Kitchen is my new favorite brunch place in the city! Service is really really slow, so come with your girlfriends to catch up. We had the crab toast, scrambled eggs with crispy oysters and carrot salad. All were great with the crispy oysters being amazing. Around 2pm, the wait for a 2 top was 15 mins, even better than tons of other famous brunch places in the city."
Sola E.,"Kearny, NJ",5/24/2019,5 star rating,"The service is hot, welcoming and fantastic. Plate, forks and other dinnerware is rustic but elegant. Cooked seafood, a must try here, is cooked in chicken stock hence has deeper flavor than ordinary restaurant. Fried chicken fills your every fantasy of fried poultry cuisine: crispiness, tenderness and finishing touches of spicy butter sauce. Black sea bass is of too much salt in broth, nevertheless its crispy fish skin orchestrate the broth and tangy topping into a harmony of taste finesse.ABC kitchen is a restaurant known for sourcing local and organic ingredients. But who says one cannot get rustic dishes and elegant style at once?"
Alison C.,"Santa Ana, CA",12/11/2019,5 star rating,"Happiest place on earth. My heart sings with every traceable bite.  Their commitment to high quality local, organic, and sustainable food is really wonderful.  Consistently delicious since the day they opened. The crab toast is by far my favorite. Yogurt and beets are a must. Pizza with farm egg is wonderful, but so is the basic and perfect margarita pizza.  The chocolate chip cookie is like magic. And once upon a time, they had a smoothie bar in the back with mind blowing creations. I think I still have the menu.  I could go on and on. Clearly nothing but cheesy love for ABCkitchen. Thank you, JGV!"
Estefany S.,"New York, NY",5/16/2021,3 star rating,"It was okay, but just okay. The decor is beautiful, service was great. The drinks were amazing. The food was just basic, nothing impressed me. We got pizza, fried chicken, burgers, tartare, calamari. It all just left a lot to be desired... it was basic."
Connie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",4/2/2015,4 star rating,"After numerous trips to NYC, and being a frequent patron of Jean George's restaurant at the Trump, I had to make my trek down to have a taste ofABC kitchen and I'm glad I did.My friend and I got reservations at noon and there was a line already formed outside. We got in and were seated promptly. We opted for the 3 course lunch and added a dish or two just so we could try a little bit of everything.  The highlight for me was the raviolo. The waitstaff did some odd things like take away our oil and vinegar when we were still nibbling on the bread, so I docked a star. But overall, food was delicious and I would come back again. Definitely try the tasting menu. It is well worth it!"
Judy N.,"Brooklyn, NY",2/25/2017,4 star rating,"Came here for dinner on a Thursday night and I was impressed! Beautiful, intimate space with very nice decor. Decor which you could also buy right around the corner at abc carpet & home! We sat at the intersection next to abc cocina and carpet & home and it was a little amusing seeing customers at the furniture shop glancing into the restaurant. Great service and while the decor was classy, everyone was casual and friendly. Now on to the food:Crab toast with lemon aioli - This is a MUST order. Crab was chilled, sweet, and so fresh on top of a thick slice of soft bread. Very meaty and the lemon aioli worked perfectly. Great start to the meal. Pretzel dusted calamari, spicy tomato and mustard aioli - Crunchy crust and tender calamari! Not sure I could tell that it was pretzel dust, but it was a great crust. The spicy tomato sauce was not that spicy (great for me!) and I loved it! The mustard aioli has quite a kick so be prepared. Mushrooms, parmesan, oregano and farm egg pizza - Wasn't planning to order pizza at first but then saw other Yelper's photos and that changed our minds real quick. Whole pieces of different mushrooms perfectly cooked on top of the pizza. The egg was a bit overcooked so it wasn't runny as I would have liked, but maybe we should have ate the egg sooner! The crust was thin and had a great crunch, but a little burnt around the edges. Note - be careful, there was pepper flakes pre-sprinkled on top and I unfortunately had a bite of flakes. Wood oven roasted Maine lobster, oregano and lemon-chili vinaigrette - The star of the meal! Beautifully cooked lobster that they brought out split on two separate plates for us. The lemon-chili vinaigrette added great flavor to the lobster. The claw meat was take out already and the outside had a bite to it from the oven. We wished there was more tail meat, but overall great lobster! Mashed potatoes with sea salt - Buttery, whipped mashed potatoes that was a shining side to the lobster! Would be back for brunch and the CRAB TOAST again!"
Aoshi L.,"Jersey City, NJ",8/8/2019,4 star rating,The fried chicken is really good! Crispy crust with juicy meat. Come with dark and white. Both pretty good. Dark meat is better though.Crab toast is like slightly better version of chain lobster restaurants.black bass is nah mediocre
Kerri O.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",1/8/2017,5 star rating,"It was pretty hard to get a reservation here but after trying many times I was finally able to land a reservation to celebrate my birthday.  The inside of the restaurant is truly beautiful with white and light wood as the main theme.  The night we went they had flower centerpiece in the main dining area and also filled with gold and purple light.  I just love how beautiful it is.I am trying to eat mainly organic so its great that abc kitchen serves organic, farm to table ingredients.  Everything we ordered were delicious and simple, the freshness of the ingredients truly shines.  I especially loved the crab toast and the roasted carrots avocado salad.  The night we went they had a shaved truffles pasta as appetizer for $36, the pasta was homemade.  I also really like the mushroom pizza, they covered every single inch of the pizza with mushroom! I read some people complained about soggy pizza but ours were crispy and not soggy at all.For dessert we got the salted caramel icecream and it was huge!! My husband and I could not finish it, then we heard the ladies sitting next to us asked the server for a half size dessert, I didnt know we could ask for half size!!Service was great too, attentive but not overly friendly.  Hope to be back!"
Felisa F.,"Brooklyn, NY",12/30/2014,5 star rating,"ABC Kitchen opened in 2010 and it's still impossible to score a reservation. I wonder who you have to have sleep with in order to get a table here [at a normal hour, no less]. Lucky for me, I did manage [without undressing] to get a 9PM spot.  Jean-Georges really brought it with his farm to table concept, the dessert was the only fault in an otherwise really stellar dinner. Food:Homemade Ricotta [$15]: The ricotta was so incredibly light and plentiful. It was swirled into a cranberry compote and served with grilled bread [on the side]. The presentation was absolutely beautiful, it kind of resembled a flower. My only complaint was the over char on the bread, it tasted a little like gasoline or the bread was grilled too close to an open flame.Pork Confit [$35]: I was incredibly blown away by the pork confit. It was almost like eating a huge slab of bacon. Speaking of bacon, that bacon marmalade was wonderfully sweet and salty. There were actually bits of bacon swimming through it. The turnips, while delicious, were the weak point of the dish. Leaving the stems attached made them really hard to eat because they were long and slightly wilted. Roasted Sunchokes [$12]: I've never had a sunchoke before, but I really love roasted vegetables. They had a deep roasted flavor and were absolutely delicious, albeit, a little overpriced. I could make these at home for a quarter of the cost.Dessert:Salted Caramel Ice Cream Sundae [$14]: Sorry, I'm not on the bandwagon for this highly praised concoction. The salted caramel ice cream was good [but it's better elsewhere] and the whipped cream was fresh. I always enjoy a sweet/savory dessert. But anyone can throw popcorn on top of a sundae, plate it over a vat of chocolate sauce, and call it inventive. Drink:My friend and I both had two rounds of the specialty vodka cocktail made with ginger and apple juice [$15]. Served in a martini glass, these these things went down fast, they weren't overly strong and just sweet enough for easy drinking. Service:I would have expected the service to be a bit more attentive. The server was basically there to do her job while the woman refilling the water was warm and kind. The atmosphere/decor of the restaurant reflects ABC Carpet and Home, a little rustic, a bit modern, and a lot pricey. This was an expensive meal at nearly $100 for two. I must admit nearly a third of the bill was devoted to alcohol. Oops. Completely worth it though."
Claudia B.,"Simi Valley, CA",12/27/2014,4 star rating,"Owned by the same chef/owner of Jean-Georges fame (Jean-Georges Vongerichten), this restaurant is a casual, organic, farm-to-table kind of dining experience.  We tried the following:Mushroom toast, pecorino, lemon and herbs Crab toast with lemon aioliMushrooms, parmesan, oregano and farm egg pizza Brussel sprouts, garlic, jalapenos and lemon pizza (minus the jalapenos)French toast with vanilla poached pears and a side of scrambled eggsEverything was delicious, fresh, and nicely prepared.  We would've liked to have tasted more dishes but were stuffed with what we had..... couldn't even finish it.  I'd like to try dinner sometime.  I'd even like to try Jean-Georges restaurant someday.We first walked through a very generic, white, beaten up door, and I thought, what the heck is this ""dump"" (based on how that door looked)....... but when we got inside, I was very pleasantly surprised to see how lovely and huge the dining room was.... and how much light and warmth the décor exuded..... such a far cry difference from the strange white door that one enters through.  (One could also enter through the ABC Carpet & Home), but we didn't go that way.)"
Indranil D.,"North Brunswick Township, NJ",11/10/2017,4 star rating,"Luv the restaurant ambiance , service top-notch....food decent. Luv the mushroom pizza but pasta was ok."
Dee C.,"Bergen County, NJ",2/7/2017,3 star rating,"Came here for lunch during restaurant week. The place is gorgeous!   We sat on the French side. Ordered from the prefixed menu. Before I continue, I must add that our waiter was amazing.  I wish I had remembered his name to give him full kudos.  Back to the food.  Soup:  Farro,chickpea and white bean.   Soup was DELICIOUS.  Problem was it wasn't hot.  If I had to guess it was  because it came served in the most beautiful, delicate bowl that dissipated every ounce of heat within seconds. Salad:  Crispy shrimp, mixed grains and citrus dressing.  Salad was good with the exception of some bits that should have been tossed instead of thrown in.  No one wants to eat the pieces of greens that were meant for the garbage.  The shrimp were a nice size but fried.  Meh.  The dressing was good. Dessert - almond cake with pears and sorbet.  - homerun. I'd love to come back here sans restaurant week."
Jane K.,"New York, NY",6/23/2018,5 star rating,"Beautiful ambiance with amazing food.It was a bit challenging to get a reservation a day before but we managed it. The decor is just so adorable that I was about to buy everything in there. From plates to interior, it was an unique experience. And on top, the food was amazing. Definitely worth a visit, this place should be loved."
Aaron O.,"Brooklyn, NY",5/22/2021,5 star rating,"Awesome, fresh food. The crab toast is incredible and has a little kick to it. The eggs benedict is perfectly cooked and sitting on a fresh and homemade English muffin. And not to mention the cocktails; the ginger margerita is fantastic, and the bartender was excellent and delightful. Highly reccomend."
kory c.,"Crofton, MD",7/29/2019,4 star rating,"Beautiful and spacious restaurant!  Really something when you walk in!  Drinks were good, appetizers were great.  Looooved the ricotta with strawberry preserves.  Had the cheeseburger and the sea bass.  Honestly...the sea bass (replaced with red snapper) wasn't great.  VERY bland and not at all impressed.  The cheese burger was really good....tons of flavor.  Although I wasn't thrilled with my entree, I would absolutely go back.  Everything else was awesome and the vibe of the restaurant was better than I expected!"
Terence L.,"San Francisco, CA",11/1/2017,4 star rating,"Came here the other night for a team dinner and was very impressed. the decor of the restaurant is very unique and nothing like I've seen before. in terms of the food, thankfully I had a chance to try a variety of their dishes. the highlights were definitely the ricotta cheese/bread, the crab toast, the sashimi, mushroom/egg pizza, and pork confit,  however pretty much everything was really good.definitely would come back here again and would recommend to anyone in the area!"
Jules H.,"Brooklyn, NY",1/11/2019,1 star rating,"This was probably the biggest rip off I've ever experienced and I've been to many many restaurants. Portions are beyond tiny and the prices for the dishes are not worth what you getting, at all. The kale salad is a joke, it's basically three letters chopped up and it's 18$ The stuff especially on the front desk has a major attitude and finding themselves very important Anyhow, never again!!! Good luck if you go there."
Prashansa D.,"Hoboken, NJ",5/15/2017,4 star rating,"A these 4 starts say, I am truly a fan! ABC Kitchen stood upto my expectations. Would definitely say make reservations ahead coz it is always full! We had reservations for 6:30, I walked expecting the place to be pretty quiet for a 6:30 dinner but there was already a wait for the walk-ins. We started our dinner with some complimentary house bread and olive oil, which were good. For appetizer we decided on the house made ""Ricotta cheese with Rhubarb compote and grilled bread"" and it was fantastic! The ricotta was just the right texture! It was creamy and not too heavy and with the rhubarb compote being the right sweetness. The grill bread tasted like it was char grilled with herbs. It was a great start! For mains we tried the ""spinach, goat cheese and herbs pizza"" and ""angel hair pasta with saffron, jalapeños, garlic and ricotta"" Both were delicious. The pizza had a good balance of herbs to spinach, spinach was not overpowering the entire flavor of the pizza. The pasta was cooked perfectly and had a good saffron flavor seeping through each bite. We were already full by the time we were done with mains. But the hit of the evening is yet to come.For dessert we went for the ""Salted caramel ice cream with caramelized popcorn and peanuts with hot fudge"" Sundae! And this really made our day! I am not a huge fan of chewy caramel but this ice cream with the dark chocolate fudge was a heavenly combination! The perfect amalgamation of popcorn, peanuts, caramel with chilly ice cream and hot fudge brought a lot of textures and dimensions to each bite. And the quantity is pretty big too!All in all, it was a perfect dinner date! I would love to go again!"
Sonal B.,"New York, NY",6/14/2019,4 star rating,"Ordered the flat bread and the fish dish. Also ordered the sushi for an appetizer. Love the food, and the Decor the vibes.Also ordered a rhubarb dessert and it was amazing. I'm definitely going there again. It is a bit pricey though, but oh well but a special occasion might be OK"
Kaitlyn J.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",11/25/2021,2 star rating,"This used to be my favorite restaurant in NYC but I went here for Thanksgiving dinner and was very disappointed. The service was terrible, and the food was just decent. I had emailed them to ask if they had a specific Thanksgiving menu and never heard back, and didn't see a special Thanksgiving menu on their website or social media (or any mention of a holiday prix fixe), or anywhere on Resy where I made the reservation, so I assumed they were just offering their normal menu. I was shocked when we sat down and it was $168/person for a 3 course prix fixe menu that was items they normally offer for twice the price of what the same items normally cost. A table next to us told us not to order the Turkey as they were leaving because it wasn't good, and the two other tables next to us had to send their food back and also complained about the service. There are many other restaurants in NYC that I'd rather spend $400+ on dinner."
Bernie T.,"Brooklyn, NY",7/7/2017,5 star rating,"Had an A+ dining experience here tonight with my husband for my birthday. We ended up snagging a last minute reservation for 5:30, and it wasn't crowded at all. Even when we left at 7, the restaurant wasn't jam packed. The decor is cool, kind of rustic modern. The food itself was absolutely phenomenal. We had the fluke starter, the roasted carrot and avocado salad, and the pork confit with a side of sautéed hemp greens. It was a bit light, but neither of us were starving. If you come in very hungry, one appetizer and one main per person should be enough. The fluke had such interesting flavors. The horseradish wasn't overpowering and went nicely with the lemon and oil. The roasted carrots had a delicious vinaigrette. I just wish that salad had had a few more seeds. The pork confit was out of this world -- melt in your mouth, and a great combination of smoky and sweet. The sautéed hemp greens were buttery and crispy. We'll have to come back to try the rest of the menu!"
Phoebe L.,"New York, NY",1/21/2019,3 star rating,"ABC is a good atmosphere spot with below average, but expensive food. I would highly recommend everyone to check out the review of ABC Kitchen on The Infatuation which accurately describes the unfortunate decline of this NYC ""staple"" restaurant.-----Quick breakdown of all parts of the dinner:Atmosphere: The best thing they have going for them is the decor and vibes of the entire place. This makes it a good restaurant for business lunches/dinners and for people who are there to just chat and not really eat the food.Pasta: Our pasta dish came out cold and overcooked. With all the pasta options in NYC, there's no reason to waste time and and stomach space on overcooked cold pasta...Pizza: We ordered the pizza With Tomatoes & Buffalo Mozzarella. Out of the 4 slices, my friend and I had one each and decided not to pack the rest. Similar to the pasta, the pizza came out cold. The tomato sauce was thinly layered on and everything was just kind of bland.Crab toast: This was good. But nothing amazing that I would come back for.Service: The best word to describe our server's attitude was apathetic. Flat tone of voice, no smiles, hard to flag down."
Haylee K.,"Jersey City, NJ",7/31/2019,3 star rating,Generally a good ambience and flavorful dishes but not worth the price.Had high expectations for raw fluke which was disappointing.
Christina C.,"New York, NY",12/17/2018,2 star rating,"Would expect better from this place but mediocre at best. Mushrooms appetizer was overpriced and the mushrooms itself were not properly cleaned - felt like I was eating a can of sand. They didn't have the bass entree so got the monkfish. Two tiny pieces of under-seasoned fish on top of brussels sprouts that were outrageously salty. I don't remember it being this way, but the place has gone a bit downhill.."
ChingWa C.,"Manhattan, NY",1/14/2017,3 star rating,"My boyfriend and I made a Friday 7:30p reservation a few weeks ago, if you are lucky sometimes they'll have one spot open the day of. After we got seated, I noticed there were a few empty tables that never got filled during my stay, so my guess is that those are for the walk ins. The atmosphere here is undeniably intimate and the service is great. They have a lot of tables in the restaurant with some big round tables in the corner. Our table is in close proximity to our neighboring table (less than 5 feet away)For appetizer, we ordered the crab toast. It was really good! I think the white sauce covered the crabmeat taste a little bit. This dish is definitely refreshing but the taste of it mainly come from the natural taste of the crab rather than a well thought creation from the chef. For main meal, my boyfriend ordered the sea bass and I ordered the bow tie pasta with veal meatballs. They are both delicious. I am just a little disappointed because they tasted ordinary. You come here definitely for the quality and freshness of the food and the atmosphere. If you're looking for a dish that will blow your mind away, then this is not the place."
Kara N.,"San Francisco, CA",1/2/2017,3 star rating,"The ambiance of the restaurant was fabulous but only come if you've got money to spend because the waiters laughed when our group of mid 20s sat down and only ordered salads and one drink. They expect every table to be spending $500+ which quite frankly, I just can't afford. Sorry I didn't order the truffle pizza for $108..."
Aaron F.,"Scottsdale, AZ",1/3/2019,5 star rating,"A posh, country styled eatery that features organic dishes on a fun atmosphere.  Enjoy a mid day brunch with biscuits and jelly doughnuts.  The juices are succulent and if you can reserve the large wooden table, I highly recommend it."
Michaek R.,"New York, NY",5/17/2021,4 star rating,One of our favorite restaurants in NYC. Best suited for birthday/celebration/friends & family in town.

Joanna L.,"Austin, TX",11/17/2018,2 star rating,"Food was decent, but nothing really makes me want to go back. My friends and I shared a cheese plate as an appetizer and I had the roasted monkfish as my entree. The food by itself probably deserved three stars, but the service that we got pushed the review back to two stars. Really not much to say, but Yelp's auto-review suggestion of two stars pretty much sums it up: ""Meh, I've experienced better"" was exactly how I felt about ABC Kitchen."
Ben S.,"Manhattan, NY",10/5/2019,4 star rating,The food and drinks here are both delicious. We started with cocktails...both very strong. Then we did a flight of wine...definitely a must! For appetizers we had the mushrooms...just ok I would not recommend. We also had the tuna tartare...amazing! For dinner I had the salmon special...it was perfectly moist and seasoned. My boyfriend has the steak which was just ok...we've had better. For dessert I had the chocolate cake and my boyfriend had the creme brûlée which he said was the best he's ever had! Definitely a place worth visiting!
Sue K.,"New York, NY",5/28/2017,3 star rating,"I love the atmosphere but food is just okay.Mushroom pizza - delicous but the bottom of the pizza was burnt a lot. Lobster - more expensive than other restaurants, but the size of the lobsters is smaller. It was too salty.Steak - too salty"
Coco L.,"Philadelphia, PA",1/24/2020,5 star rating,"Absolutely delicious. We ordered the calamari, squash toast, the steak, French fries, tagliatelle, the straciatella, and the cookie plate. The winners were the steak and the squash toast. The French fries are also delicious. I could eat that squash toast every day and be happy. I didn't love the pasta but our server, Be, was so kind and the ambience is so amazing. All in all, a five star meal and five star service.  tips: cocktails are delicious and don't skip the bread basket."

Sherry Z.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",11/29/2016,4 star rating,Love the decor and atmosphere!!!! Came here for early Saturday brunch. The service was great. Not so noisy. Just in general a great place for friends or date.The food was good but not as good as I originally expected (maybe I've heard too much good things and set my expectation unreasonably high).Small dishesCrab toast was special. Nice flavors and easy to eat.Roasted Brussel sprouts was good. But how can roasted Brussel sprouts not be good.Bowtie Pasta was flavorful and cute. But I wouldn't say this is a pasta place either.Mushroom pizza was interesting. There is a raw egg on top... so kind of messy to eat.Dessert:Caramel ice cream sundae was my favorite part of the meal. Really really sweet but still in a good way.Cream brûlée is a bit too thick for my taste. Kind of like eating butter.
Lydier H.,"Los Angeles, CA",12/13/2016,3 star rating,"I came here in a raining day. I was surprised when walked in.  From outside small signage and entrance i thought this is a casual dinning place but the majority people are white collar professionals.  But that day, nobody seem bothered by my wet tennis shoes and yogi bags:pThe only thing I'm not happy about is the egg ravioli I ordered for $35. I felt I was eating a golden dumpling as oppose to a single ravioli, served in vegetarian style on tomato sauce. Other than that, the bartender was really nice. I sat in the bar for the entire afternoon till the rain stopped."

Art C.,"Brooklyn, NY",10/24/2016,3 star rating,"3.5 stars 'cuz my friends liked this place more than I did. The dining room is almost as nice as ABC Cocina, but I like that dining room more. That said, the drinks here were just as tasty, and the ambiance, as ambiance goes, was really nice.The service here was a little off in my opinion, whether it was the waiters showing up at odd times, or not showing up when we really wanted them to. Just a little bit off...Other than that the food was pretty interesting. I think my main issue was there was an ingredient that was used in many of the dishes that I found off-putting. Maybe it was just me, because the other three friends that I went with loved it. If I had to guess I'd say it was maybe horseradish or something like that. I don't like even a hint of that taste...But the dishes were good. The fried chicken was special, but I don't really like my greens drenched in butter... The pork shoulder was also interesting but it kinda fell apart into an indistinguishable mush (I think it was shredded and then molded instead of just taking the time to perfect the preparation of a whole piece of pork). The taste was there though.I think the most successful dish was the fish which everyone thought was excellent.For the price I think there are better restaurants, and actually I prefer ABC Cocina, so..."
Lillian Y.,"New York, NY",8/30/2018,4 star rating,"Food: 4/5Ambiance: 4/5Service: 4/5Value: 3.5/5I've been here a few times over the years, and nothing is quite ""wrong"" with this place but the food doesn't excite me. I also find some items overpriced. This is (I think) an older JG restaurant, and the menu reflects what was 'en vogue"" 10+ years ago. However, the space itself is completely modern and beautiful. Crab Toast (5/5) is something I could eat all the time, the crab is so fresh and sweet! Calamari (4/5) is fine, it's not the crunchiest and I didn't detect ""pretzels"" but the dipping sauces are good. Kale salad (4/5) is quite zingy but really needs a few more elements to justify $17. Fettucine with beans and pesto (3.5/5) is just pretty boring. I liked the summer squash pizza (4/5) much better - the crust was crisped almost as if fried. I wouldn't recommend the Black sea bass (3/5) unless you are dieting... served in a too-salty clear broth like a chinese steamed fish preparation. Definitely go for some fried chicken though (5/5). It was one of my favorite things, the exterior is ULTRA crisp and light. I was also a fan of the pork chop (4.5/5), a well-cooked thick slab with classically good pairings of cherry and crispy onions. I dared not order a side vegetable again, last time our greens were literally 4 bites. Save room for dessert. A large slice of chocolate cake (5/5) is airy and bouncy; the crumbly almond cake (5/5) is surprisingly addicting; and the sundae is the salty sugary dessert bomb to satisfy sweet tooths. TLDR: a solid safe spot for taking the parents, last-min special events, and a good option in this area. You'll have a good meal, very good service, but you might forget what you ate by next week."
Danan R.,"New York, NY",9/8/2018,4 star rating,"A very solid Farm-to-Table JG establishment with the expected beautiful, spacious and light interior and semi-trendy, energetic vibe.  It's a nice break from the typical dimly-lit establishments.  The staff here, as can be expected, are very knowledgeable and attentive.  The food itself is simple but well-crafted and prepared so that the freshness of the locally-sourced ingredients and the innate flavors are brought forth with minimal alterations.  Definitely worth a try and great for a small dinner with friends - highly recommend sharing the dishes.  1. Fried chicken: Light and crispy seasoned batter with juicy and tender breast served with a spicy butter.  It's delicious - make sure you dig in as soon as it is served as it's best when hot and fresh from the kitchen!  The accompanying sauteed chard is a perfect complement to the fried chicken.  2. Crab toast: If you are a crab lover, this is a must-try.  Topped with a very generous portion of fresh lump crabmeat and a tangy refreshing lemon aioli.  A great starter and perfect for sharing - unless you are like me and love crab.  Then order at least 2 servings.3. Black Sea Bass: Tender sea bass seared to absolute perfection with a hint of basil and spice from the slices of jalapeno on top.  The accompanying sauteed spinach was a perfect pairing - light, silky, and savory.  The side of seasoned and simultaneously crispy and tender roasted potatoes completed the dish . 4. Buttermilk cheddar biscuits: Absolutely delicious - buttery and flaky with the perfect amount of cheddar.  If you thought that Red Lobster's Cheddar Bay Biscuits are good - you have not tried these.5. Pretzel-crusted calamari: I couldn't actually taste the pretzel flavor in the crust but that aside, the calamari itself is quite tender and good with an extra salt kick (maybe that is from the pretzel crust?).  The mustard and tomato aioli add a nice spicy kick."
Andy H.,"San Francisco, CA",11/13/2016,4 star rating,"I'm so glad I was finally able to try ABC Kitchen after living in the city for 6 months. This has definitely been on my list of things to eat the moment i moved here. I was not disappointed.We ordered the crab toast, fries (duh), mushroom pizza and the sundae for dessert.the crab toast was the winner of the night. it was light, but had the perfect toast texture and i liked the light amount of aioli they dabbed on top. i really only wanted to try ABC for their caramel popcorn sundae. the portion is huge, btw. 3 scoops of ice cream. worth every bite. one thing to mention: our waiter seemed a bit slow. both in service and in life. i dont know, he seemed a little high. it took him awhile to mentally process our order and at moments, would see him standing against the wall staring off into space."
Jason G.,"West Babylon, NY",3/2/2019,1 star rating,"I was so excited to check this place out because of the reviews and general hype, but dad to say it was probably one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. We ordered the meat and cheese platter to start and the prosciutto smelled a bit weird and had excess fat on it. When I told one of the employees, they told me that's the way it comes. I come from a meat and cheese background and that's not how it's supposed to be. I asked for crackers but they said the best they had was toasted bread, but even that came out extremely burnt. Our drinks were watered way down. My friends ravioli had one peice of burned or over cooked ravioli. And the burger I ordered medium well was medium at best. Fries were coldish and droopy. Within 35 minutes we paid the check and left. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. It may have been great at one time, but can't say the same now."
Alli J.,"San Rafael, CA",12/27/2018,5 star rating,"Amazing atmosphere and fantastic staff! Our server, Kristen V went above and beyond to make sure we had a memorable night. My friends and I were visiting NYC and made the Saturday night reservation weeks in advance (about 5 weeks). Throughout the night, we had exceptional service on top of delicious food.+ Great wine selection (and helpful som)+ Delicious pasta and pizza+ New specials, ie: butternut squash risotto+ Phenomenal staff & ambiance I cannot recommend this place enough and THANK YOU KRISTEN!!"
Adam C.,"Brooklyn, NY",4/1/2018,5 star rating,"Made a reservation for Saturday brunch (wait time without is 45mins to 1 hour) and had a great meal. I had a burger which was perfectly cooked, and the fries were great too. Girlfriend had the goat cheese and spinach omelette which she enjoyed as well.We had the beets with yoghurt starter which was so so good, highly recommend. Will be back!"
Andrea A.,"Lehigh Acres, FL",10/8/2018,3 star rating,"Beautiful restaurant but, overpriced and food was mediocre.Visited on a Saturday afternoon for brunch. Reservations are a must if you want specific seating or don't wish to wait or for pretty much any reason.We had a group of 4 and had made reservations but, they gave us seats that had stools and with one of our guests being pregnant, we though it better to switch to another table. We were 1st told that there were none but, the bar. After another request and some time, we were given a different table which we appreciated.We had a friendly waiter but, some of the ways the food was described didn't seem appealing. Things like-""tomato water, French toast that's kinda raw in the middle"". Safe to say we didn't order any of those. The brunch offerings were not substantial compared to other places I've been. Seemed more lunch like to me. I ordered a cup of green juice which was quite expensive. I had the spinach and ricotta omelette that didn't do much for me besides being fresh. It came with potatoes that were quite hard on the outside and didn't offer much in the way of flavor.We did have some good, flaky cheddar biscuits though. I got to meet Deepak Chopra(whom I admire greatly) on my way to my table  so, that was a nice touch but, I would probably not return. I could get a cheaper meal elsewhere or with more variety for brunch or better tastes."
Rebecca S.,"Bellmore, NY",9/9/2017,5 star rating,"While I never give a 5 star rating, there was absolutely nothing I can say we didn't like. Not only was the restaurant stunning, the food was incredible. The homemade ricotta appetizer was so creamy (and probably my favorite part of dinner), the spinach pizza was the perfect size and had a great, crispy crust. For our entrees we had the salmon and the sea bass and they were out of this world. Lastly for dessert, we had the sundae which had the best salted caramel ice cream we've had. This place comes with a hefty price tag but it was worth every penny!"
Nancy A.,"Los Angeles, CA",5/11/2017,3 star rating,"This was very disappointing. We went for lunch and everything was over seasoned. First, the bread to start was cold. For the main dish, we got the 1. Pretzel crusted calamari, 2. the Angel Hair pasta, 3. Sea bass, 4. Roasted cod. The main proteins (fish) were well cooked but the sauces for every dish was way too salty, over-seasoned. The pasta was soaked in oil. However, I do have to say, their fresh orange juice was pretty amazing. I would just go and to-go an orange juice and be happy. The service was nice too. I heard their brunch was really good though. But,agh, at least for lunch, the sauces just killed it :("
Anne B.,"New York, NY",9/7/2019,5 star rating,"Flavor combinations and textures are delicious and inventive. Mismatched and handmade plates make for an artful presentation. Even the table itself was worthy of conversation--it was made of joined wood giving the impression of a cross-section of a 300 year-old redwood tree. I fell in love with the strawberry shortbread . . . crispy lemon thyme meringue, buttery shortbread and fresh strawberries with a pillow of mascarpone."
Jason P.,"Seattle, WA",1/1/2019,5 star rating,"Amazing atmosphere. Super hipster, J Crew esque vibes. Sparkling juices and water available. Even better spirits and cocktails to choose from. Food was tasty. I am not a vegetarian, love to pester vegetarians for their bland food, but ABC's veggie burger was spectacular. One bite into the burger and I felt as if I could enjoy being a vegetarian.(But then the craving for meat kicked in later in the evening before dinner). The salad that comes with the salmon entree, woah. Life changing. The almond cake, even better. 10/10 would recommend this spot to anybody in the mood for a little stroll down to flatiron. Great stuff!"
Kathleen S.,"Brooklyn, NY",1/22/2017,3 star rating,"I ordered the crab toast. Pretty good, but felt that the bread was overtoasted and too hard. It was also too salty and had waaay too much mayonnaise and oil. There was a generous amount of crab, which was very fresh and tasty. For $16, the portion size is on the smaller side. It was cut into four pieces, so good for sharing as an appetizer, but not filling if eating as a main."
Daniela L.,"New York, NY",4/23/2017,4 star rating,"I'd had my eye on ABC Kitchen for a while, but it took a special occasion (and the patience to make reservations well in advance) to finally secure a seat in the dining room.I was highly skeptical of the roast carrot and avocado salad that everyone raves about. After all, at the end of the day, aren't they just carrots? Oh man, I was so wrong. I had no idea it was possible for carrots to be that delicious. Slightly charred and perfectly roasted, they balanced well with the avocado. The crunch that would normally be present in the root vegetable was instead offered by the pine nuts, sprinkled on a bed of arugula and sprouts. The appetizer was finished off with a dollop of sour cream and a couple of croutons.I'd return just for this salad alone, which is a little embarrassing to admit, but it's seriously that good.The ricotta ravioli, on the other hand, were stuffed with so much ricotta that it overwhelmed the entire dish. I found myself constantly searching for more tomato sauce to counteract the amount of cheese bursting out of each piece. It's a shame, because the ricotta itself was high quality; it wasn't overly dense, or worse, grainy. Its smooth, creamy texture earned the pasta some points, but sometimes too much of a good thing can be a detriment.For dessert, the warm apple pie with maple pecan ice cream was a wonderful way to end the meal. I initially expected a slice, and was surprised to see a miniature apple pie on the plate (about the size of a personal pot pie). The crust was flaky and glazed with brown sugar, and the maple pecan ice cream complemented the apple filling within the pastry.ABC Kitchen lives up to its reputation without question. The service is attentive, the food is made with care, and the ambience is ideal for a low-key date or evening out with friends."
Fancypants X.,"San Francisco, CA",7/13/2016,4 star rating,"The shabby exterior reveals nothing of the chic, rustic gorgeousness that awaits inside. Yelper, you're in for a treat. Lunch service was nothing short of excellent thanks to our down-to-earth server & appropriately-timed pauses between drinks, appetizers, & entrees.I was warned that my menu choices, essentially two salads, were each hearty & filling. Challenge accepted! I didn't think a couple veggies & a grain dish would put me over the edge, but oh, they did!Roast carrot & avocado salad was amazing. The impeccably-cooked carrots had formed a sweet, caramelized texture and the crunchy seeds & sour cream ""dressing"" was lighter than I expected it to be. My entree, crispy shrimp salad with mixed grains, was slightly less impressive only because I thought the shrimp were slightly overcooked and too heavily breaded; I would've appreciated a light & airy flash fry on them. The grains were indeed hearty, and wonderfully coated in a meyer lemon dressing. Dessert was unthinkable after our meal, however, I plan on leaving room for sweets next time!"
Angie C.,"New York, NY",10/27/2016,4 star rating,"Came here with friends on a Friday night without reservation. We waited by the bar for about 30 mins before we got a table. The food and drinks were good, especially their desserts! Saluted caramel sundae was so amazing, the ice cream matched so well with caramel popcorn! The ladies who took care of our table were very friendly. She recommended us good signature dishes and kids pasta. We had a good time dining there."
Peter N.,"Westhampton Beach, NY",8/20/2016,4 star rating,"Recently came for lunch.  Service was a bit slow -- we waited nearly a half hour in between  our appetizers and entrees. We sampled the sea bass, salmon, and pretzel crusted calamari.  All were fresh and delicious. Even the china makes an impression.  Apart from the slow service, the only other downsides were the prices (nothing new here, it's New York) and the portions seem a touch small.  But overall, a pleasant experience.Worth trying during Restaurant Week."
Amy G.,"San Francisco, CA",9/27/2014,5 star rating,"I heard great things about this restaurant from my first week in the city, and finally tried it out after two years.The food here is phenomenal - I came for brunch and ordered the crab toast and french toast, both which had deep flavor, were decadently rich, and superbly unique. I really cannot explain how well made these dishes were, and I think phenomenal may be the only word to describe. I also ordered the very popular salted caramel popcorn sundae for dessert, but to my dismay this dish was not as on par as the others, and was a bit too sweet for my taste. I highly recommend asking your waiter to guide you through the menu or provide their suggestion.The ambiance was very unique - well-spaced, bright, trendy/chic interior decor. The space is very beautiful as you walk in and there's ample space between tables given the location. There's also an interesting combination of wood along with glass and metal, and the restaurant is conjoined with a furniture shop which is interesting.Service was fine, but it's more casual than formal. The waiters are very knowledgeable, kind, and check in often.Some items I disagree with about other reviews. First, I certainly do not think the restaurant excelled on every dish, especially since the salted caramel popcorn I did not find suited my palate, and in reading the reviews there has definitely been dissatisfaction voiced on some options. That being said, you'll be safe if you ask the waiters what's good and popular - I personally don't like French toast, but would have regretted coming here if I didn't order it, per my waiter's recommendation.The bill rakes up for the food you're getting - my three items along with a diet coke totaled to a bill of $55 including tip. Based on other reviews, I understand how an uneven experience here can lead to strong disappointment."
Sophie P.,"New York, NY",11/11/2017,4 star rating,"Gorgeous venue and impeccable food! I've been to ABC Kitchen a few years ago and was blown away by the experience. This time, my family and I cam back to celebrate my parents' anniversary. We made a reservation a few weeks in advance because this place is so popular. We started off with some drinks. We tried the the apple bijou, carrotini, and black mission fig martini. All three were delicious - the apple bijou was sweet and refreshing, the carrotini (my favorite) uses fresh carrot juice, and the martini was dark and strong. They were all $16, which was definitely pricey but it was a special occasion. For appetizers, we had the chicken liver toast, shaved raw fluke with gooseberries, and roasted carrot and avocado salad. The chicken liver toast was delicious, but I the chicken liver was spread so thin that I was left wanting more. The shaved fluke was refreshing with the sweetness the fruits and the kick of the chilis. Our favorite was definitely the salad though. It was actually a generous portion, which chunks of avocados, tufts of greens, and whole carrots. I don't understand how carrots can be that sweet and flavorful! For mains, we had the angel hair pasta with saffron, black sea bass, and crispy pork confit. The pasta was a bit of a let down. Although the taste was good and I liked the chunks of ricotta, the pasta was too soft and came out lukewarm. The sea bass was cooked just right, but the taste wasn't memorable. The pork confit on the other hand was amazing. I loved how they gave you two types of preparation - one that was crispy and one that was stewed until incredibly tender. For dessert we ordered the apple pie with Saigon cinnamon ice cream. The pastry was flakey and the center was gooey, and it paired nicely with the ice cream. We also got two mini chocolate cupcakes as a gift from the restaurant. It was such a sweet surprise!Overall, it was a lovely dining experience! Definitely pricey, but it's worth the occasional splurge!"
H L.,"Rye, NY",7/6/2018,5 star rating,"ABC Kitchen's decor is full of contrasts, quirky and fun in many ways yet somehow manages to be trendy and chic at the same time. For example its bare concrete walls in the main dining area are unpainted, with exposed pipes and wirings overhead. On those same ceilings hung some fabulously intricate chandeliers. Strategically placed throughout the restaurant are art sculptures crafted from branches of trees and continuing the wood theme, bar tables carved out from the trunks of trees. In the dining area, modish white tables and chairs are employed. This juxtaposition of styles extended to its tableware, with the restaurant using mismatched vintage floral chintzy plates and a line of distinctly white tableware. After taking in the artistic flair of our surroundings, we turned our attention to the menu and ordered the Crab Toast to start. They were delicious - generous portions of fresh crabmeat on slices of warm toast dabbed with olive oil. Not surprisingly, the wedges of lemon on the side were left untouched. We eschewed traditional brunch favourites and instead chose two fish entrees. The first was Roasted Hake with fava beans & artichoke hearts in a spring garlic-lemon broth. The hake had a wonderful crispy finish but the flesh within was very tender, with a melt-in-your-mouth consistency. The inclusion of fava beans was unusual, but they complemented the fish and garlicky broth very well.  Our second choice, Black Sea Bass with chilies, spinach and basil was equally stellar. The sea bass was seared to perfection, its firm sweet flesh exuded a hint of basil possibly from the judicious addition of basil oil. Sautéed spinach leaves provided layers of silkiness while a few slices of pickled jalapeño peppers atop contributed a touch of heat to this dish. Would recommend getting a side of Buttermilk and Crawford Cheddar Biscuits. These were absolutely scrumptious, buttery and flaky with a lovely salty tang. So impressed were we by the food we ate thus far, that despite being quite full, we couldn't possibly pass up the offer of dessert. We got the Sundae to share. The salted caramel ice cream was fairly regular, except this scoop was lying in a most delightful pool of chocolatey caramel hot fudge sauce with candied peanuts & popcorn and a dollop of freshly whipped cream as toppings. Full marks for taste and presentation!"
Celine L.,"Los Angeles, CA",6/26/2016,4 star rating,"After hearing about ABC Kitchen from friends, I decided to make a reservation and check it out myself! The restaurant is gorgeous- simple yet modern, but it was very dark inside. We had to look at our menus with the candles as it was that dark, and we ordered a couple dishes to share. Crab toast with lemon aioli- highlight of the meal. Must order! Generous servings of crab with a nice light dressing to it.Mushroom pizza, parmesan,oregano and farm- bomb. The egg was perfectly runny, and the mushrooms were delectable! Asparagus pizza, bacon, ricotta, parmesan and black pepper- not as good as the mushroom (still yummy), but if you love asparagus, this is for you! The top is criss crossed layered with thinly sliced asparagus, and there's a ton of bacon everywhere. Nice combination of everything. House made chicken and pork sausage with pistachio, potatoes and wholegrain mustard- this was okay. Would not recommend.Fettuccine, english peas, sweet onions and basil-pistachio pesto- solid pasta dish! We finished this in minutes.ABC Kitchen I felt was a little hyped up, but it was still good! Cocktails were nice and light and summery, and we also got an olive oil cake to finish which was delectable. Glad I got to check this place out while in NYC!"
Alex B.,"Glencoe, IL",6/26/2018,4 star rating,"Had lunch here and really enjoyed it.  The place is surprisingly large but tables are well spaced so it makes for a comfortable setting.The lunch menu was heavy with fresh ingredients and everything I had was bursting with big flavors.  Tuna Sashimi with ginger and mint was fantastic. The dressing was very citrusy and just tart enough to compliment, but not overwhelm the fish.  Bibb Salad was even better - the dressing is tart and spicy with Tarragon, I really loved it.  Nice tender lettuces and the chicken paillard was shockingly lightly grilled and juicy.  My only regret is that I could not indulge in any of the delicious looking cocktails which I saw some (lucky) folks indulging in. Next time I will come back when I am not on a business lunch and can indulge, the cocktails looks like they take a similar approach to fresh ingredients as the food."
Tim R.,"San Fernando Valley, CA",3/16/2017,4 star rating,"Great ExperienceHad dinner here and shared the following dishes with my wife.Crab Toast - favorite dish of the meal, loved the garlic rub on the toastCarrot Avocado Salad - fresh and tastyBowtie Pasta with meatballs - great combo, perfectly madeOrganic Fried Chicken - not a fan, wish we got a fish option instead Apple Pie with Ice Cream - sooooo good, not a slice, but a mini pie Also had the Ginger Margarita, great well balanced drink. Very attentive service and a seamless team effort."
Amrita A.,"New York, NY",6/24/2018,3 star rating,"On entering ABC Kitchen, the vibe and the decor totally and completely grip you in. The interiors are chic and the servers are attentive, and the place itself is almost always buzzing busily. I am a loyal patron of Jean Georges restaurants, and I love ABC cocina, so naturally I had very high expectations of my first visit to ABC kitchen.  On a Sunday evening, we had to wait 30 minutes for our table which wasn't so bad. Between the four of us we ordered-Chicken Liver Patè on toast- the flavor was incredible but unfortunately I bit into a sharp piece of plastic while eating it and the server was very apologetic and gracious enough to admit to there being a mistake and to strike it off the bill. We also got a few complimentary sides to make up for this incident.For the complimentary sides we got-  fries, peas and mashed potatoes. I must say that the peas were the best tasting peas I have ever had. Having said that, ABC Kitchen has stellar produce which is sourced fresh and organic and one can taste that in the food too. The fries were nice as well.For mains we ordered-Fried chicken with collard greens- this was the best dish of the night. I have not had better fried chicken and collard greens any where, and I have eaten quite a few. The presentation was beautiful as well.Roasted Carrot Salad with goats cheese and avocado- I loved everything about it. The carrots were definitely the hero of the dish.Grilled Sea Bass- very average. The fish wasn't seasoned well and had a slight smell to it. Unfortunately, I was quite underwhelmed by this dish.Salmon- this too was nothing spectacular.Overall, I realized that the vegetables really do shine in the dishes and it's easy to see why ABC kitchen prides itself in its produce. But having said that, I don't think I would be so eager to return any time soon."
Jinny T.,"Jersey City, NJ",8/18/2016,1 star rating,"It was a disappointing dining experience. We went for restaurant week lunch. We did expect it would be busy but we didn't expect that the service was like this. We needed to ask everything such as water, bread even our wine pairing by ourselves. Our server didn't introduce himself or say anything when he gave us the menus. While we were having appetizers, we found out all of other tables had bread on the tables. & we did see a small plate of salt and a small plate olive oil. So we asked our server if we can get some breads. (We did take some time to find our server.) We got wine pairing for our pre-fixe but the last wine didn't come with out dessert. At that time, out server was disappeared, so we asked someone else to find him and for our wine. The wine came after few minutes but we've finished our desserts already. Therefore, we had nothing to pair with.The servers didn't explain or say anything when they served our dishes or took away the empty plates. We couldn't find our server for a long time when we needed him.Overall, the food was good but not that impressive. The services were very poor. I wouldn't go back again."
Chris O.,"Chicago, IL",1/20/2020,4 star rating,"We sat at the bar for lunch. The hostess was a bit intense but she helped us finagle a seat. Swanky atmosphere but lots of kids at lunch. Pricey but the food was really good. Chardonnay and Boudreaux both perfect.Crab Toast with Lemon Aïoli - Lives up to the hype. Seems light even though it is quite decadent. Delicious and worth every bite. Rousted Cauliflower Soup, Chili Oil, Herbs. - Mild, warm and delicious. A great soup for a cold afternoon. Very filling.House made Ricotta Ravioli, Herbs, Tomato Sauce - perfectly al dente pasta with a light, fluffy, rich, filling. Yummy."
Sophia H.,"San Francisco, CA",6/1/2016,3 star rating,"Given the high Yelp reviews, I was actually pretty surprised by how mediocre the food tasted here. Maybe it's cause I'm from SF where this concept of farm fresh organic ingredients in food is really big, so there are lots of better options.I came with my bf for dinner. Since we didn't have reservations, we decided to show up right when dinner time started. They seated us at high stool tables near the bar rather than in the back, which looked really pretty/romantic. We didn't really mind and were just happy to get a table.For entrees we decided to try the sea bass and mushroom pizza based on reviews and our server's recommendations. Both were meh, though I think the pizza was better. The bass was TINY and honestly was not cooked so well. It was a bit overdone for me and I'm not surprised since it seemed like they basically boiled it in broth. The flavors were so simple and too basic for $32 - I think basically lemon and garlic. I'm a small person and I probably could've eaten two orders of the fish and still be hungry. The mushroom pizza was a good idea because without it we'd probably leave with half empty stomachs. It was pretty big and came with tons of mushroom. The egg sounded good on paper but was really tiny and maybe one slice got 90% of the yolk. The serve free sourdough bread here, which tasted stale. Not great but we ate a lot of it since the entrees were disappointing and not filling. I'd recommend passing and taking your money elsewhere for higher value & better tasting food."
Emily L.,"Downtown Core, Toronto, Canada",2/1/2017,4 star rating,"Five stars for the services and three stars for food. So, 4 stars for this experience.My friends and I were there for the restaurant week. The appetizer soup doesn't look nice but actually tastes good. I ordered the mushroom pizza. I saw people recommend it. It looks good when it first came with an medium raw egg in the middle of the pie. But it just doesn't even taste as good as some 99 cents pizza place. Dessert is just ok, a single scoop of ice cream only for 3 dollars. Environment made up for food though. The decoration was great and the light was really comfortable."
Lauren H.,"New York, NY",3/29/2019,4 star rating,"Fun, modern and romantic atmosphere.  Crab toast is five stars - wonderful ratio of flavorful crab on perfectly toasted bread.  It is simple and refreshing.  Wasn't as big of a fan of the spinach ricotta pizza, although the texture of the crust was divine, in my opinion the flavor was a little too yeasty and the cheese was a little too strong.  Sea bass was delicious - outside had a nice crust on it and the lemon added a good twist.  The almond cake itself was five stars! However, I think that it would be better paired with a creamier ice cream/sorbet.  The almond and pear garnish enhanced, but the pear sorbet didn't really compliment the cake - it was a little too icy and overpowering.  Perhaps a lighter pear ice cream (or even vanilla or milk flavored) would bring the dish to five stars in my mind.  Will definitely be back to try other items on the menu."
Kathy L.,"Edison, NJ",7/21/2016,4 star rating,"It is pretty hard to get a reservation for four people during the peak hours. I did it 30 days in advance and luckily got one at 7:30pm on a Monday.  We got there on time and it was packed already. We waited 10 minutes for our table ready.We tried following stuff:1. Crab toast - kind of oily but taste really good. Recommend!2. Pretzel dusted calamari - so so, not special and the portion is small comparing to the price $18 3. Line caught tuna sashimi - ok4. Shaved raw fluke -presentation is in Michelin classic way and taste is good.5. Fettuccine with pesto - good. Small portion is not that much6. Mushrooms & egg pizza - good7. Black Sea bass - it's tender but the herbs source made it a little bit sour taste.8. Baby salmon - we asked between rare and medium rare. It was good.9. Summer beans as side dish - recommend! I love they put hazelnuts inside 10. Cherry pie - ok11. Sundae with salt caramel ice cream - recommend!"
Amit J.,"Jersey City, NJ",12/3/2016,5 star rating,"Had an amazing experience at ABC Kitchen! We didn't have a reservation and walked in for brunch, so decided to wait for a table which took about 45 minutes. For those that don't have reservations and don't want to wait as long, the bar was first come first serve so took 30 minutes from the time we arrived for us to get seats at the bar while our table opened up. When are table was ready, we were treated to an elegant table towards the back with large, embroidered cushion sofa chairs. The server for very friendly and really knowledgeable with the menu items. All the food was delicious, I feel as if you probably can't go wrong with anything you order from here. We got the Buttermilk and Crawford Cheddar Biscuits as an appetizer ($9), which beat my all time favorite of Red Lobster biscuits! We ordered the Mushrooms, Parmesan, Oregeno and Farm Egg Pizza ($22) and the Scrambled Eggs, Crispy Oysters and Hot Sauce Butter ($23) as the entrees. Everything was so good, and if I went back I'd probably order the same selections. Looking forward to going back here soon!"
Sanaa H.,"Manhattan, NY",12/22/2016,5 star rating,"With hundreds of restaurants in NYC and the hype surrounding them there's only a few that live up to that expectation and ABC Kitchen is certainly one of them. I've dined here twice now: once a few years ago, and the second time just this past weekend. I've only been here for brunch and both times I had to make the reservation well in advance. And by well in advance I mean several weeks.From the chic decor, to the dimly lit dining room with hanging chandeliers, the restaurant is every bit rustic, warm, and inviting. The restaurant was of course extra done up for the holidays with garland and lights strung everywhere. As we were waiting for our food, ""Santa Clause"" happened to make his way through the restaurant in full costume ringing his bell. He was headed towards ABC home (which is connected to the restaurant) for all the little kids waiting to meet him. It was such a cute little surprise for all the Sunday morning brunchers.Now let's get down to the meat of this review (if you've made it this far that is). ABC Kitchen is known for their use of fresh organic ingredients, sourced locally, and non gmo products. Everything is made in house and tastes fresh, clean, and just delicious. I started off with with their beet juice, which is a must to try if you're into the juicing trend at all!For savory we were debating whether to order the Eggs Benedict or their infamous mushroom and egg pizza. We decided to go for the breakfast pizza to try something new and I have to say we didn't regret it. The mix of truffle oil and crushed red pepper added such a great taste to the pizza.For sweet we ordered the French toast with caramelized apple and the popcorn sundae. What I loved about the French toast was that it wasn't too eggy and underdone on the inside. Topped with the fresh maple syrup it was just too good to be true. And let's not forget the popcorn sundae: the perfect combination of sweet and salty.From the last time I dined here, to my experience this time around, it was just as good if not better than what I remember.I'll definitely be back to check out more of their menu :)"
Danielle S.,"Manhattan, NY",7/28/2016,1 star rating,"Service seemed good until another table of white couple came. The server explained a LOT more than what she did to us. Very detailed explanation of the menu and suggestion. Food wise is a huge disappointment. Do they really know how to cook? We didn't come here for restaurant week but we were lazy so just went with the prix fixe. We did order a crib fritter just to try some regular stuff on their menu, instead of only restaurant week menu. First was fluke, which was very very sour. Fresh tho. Second was grilled shrimp and quinoa. Shrimp was fine, the quinoa was very very sour. The crab flatters were mediocre, I mean it's not bad but you can get it anywhere. Very regret to come here for lunch. Waiting time was long, average of 15 mins between courses even for desserts.Food here reminds me of the food I have on international flights. One of few restaurants that has high ratings but I actually really don't like the food."
Sophia M.,"Bronx, NY",1/1/2019,3 star rating,"Food: 7/10! Our group ordered: eggs benedict, french toast, spinach goat cheese pizza and eggs with oysters. Eggs Benedict was good! Nothing to write home about but my friends were satisfied. Spinach and goat cheese pizza was fantastic, the dill really makes the difference! I added an egg and that was not a bad move hehe :). Eggs and oysters also a delicious choice. French toast was sweet for me but my friends loved it! Drinks: turmeric drink, red drink was so so yummy. Friend got a mimosa, served in a little flute. He was sad it was such a little glass haha, but it tasted great! Service: this is where things fell flat. The waiter was great but there were SEVERAL issues with our ticket. One person ordered a coffee, but somehow our entire party was charged for the coffee. The manager was checking in and when my friend said something, he quickly and kindly amended the ticket. Later after we paid the bill my friend noticed that we had been charged for the bar drinks we paid for at the bar...twice! The manager was apologetic and then randomly a waiter came with the exact drinks we ordered, we told him we never ordered it... it was chaotic and a weird way to the end the meal. For such a famous and well regarded restaurant this seemed as if it it should below their standards. Lesson being: check your bill before you leave, there's a strong chance your being over charged for two different items haha. Ambience: 10/10! Quite beautiful. Full of plants, dimly lit, gorgeous ceramic mugs and lovely floral plates."
Sarah L.,"Manhattan, NY",7/27/2019,1 star rating,The experience of a Dinner with the pricing of a fine dining restaurant ...Like many of Vongerichten restaurants are a hit or miss and very inconsistent.I had experienced ABC before and it was good. Last night was a disaster. We felt the service was rushed and not attentive.The menu lacked options. When  on the menu lots of options were not available. We felt misled because while the restaurant was a participating restaurant of Restaurant Week we were not offered a special menu for Dinner.
Sarah J.,"Vernon Hills, IL",1/2/2020,1 star rating,"Food is mediocre and overly priced. Servers are arrogant, rude, condescending, and maybe a touch racist?..just atrocious. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place, there are plenty of other great restaurants in NYC."
Merve C.,"Columbus, OH",3/17/2017,4 star rating,"Great ambiance and decoration but very very busy at all times. As many others shared in their reviews its tough to get a proper table here so were seated at the high stools and served dinner which was ok since we didn't want to wait an hour for a table. started off with great wine and cheese then we ordered the Kale salad which was a good start it had a nice citrusy flavor, then the sea bass was my entree and that was delicious! They have a great decoration and a fantastic chef but I am not a huge fan of the service and overcrowded loud space."
Joan L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",4/26/2014,5 star rating,"Must thank my fellow BPB Yelper Brenda P for putting ABC on my radar. My husband & I had a fabulous meal here on a recent NY trip. I also must compliment whoever answers the phone when I called to make a reservation.  Calling just a few days ahead, there were no tables available. However, the reservationist went out of her way to ask if she could make a reservation for me not only at any Jean George restaurant, but any restaurant in the area!  Great training or she was just super nice!Without a reservation we arrived at 530 and were seated at a bar table. In order to try as many things as possible we ordered 4 apps & 2 mains. I know, gluttony!  Our first app, the Spring Pea Soup was probably the weakest for me. The peas were a little hard. Also, it was luke warn. Perhaps it was supposed to be like this was but I really like my soups hot. The Housemade Ricotta with Rhubarb Compote was very unusual but very good:  smooth, tasty ricotta with tangy rhubarb, served with grilled bread. Even my husband who does not usually try new things loved the rhubarb. Crab Toast came next. It seems relatively simple, a crab mixture on toast, however it was a burst of flavor in your mouth (just a tad too salty but hey, I would not hesitate to order again!). The Ricotta Cavatelli with Peas, Mint, & Smoked Bacon was excellent! The flavors melded perfectly together with the bacon giving it a great smokiness & the ricotta providing decadent creaminess. I could have been done then but we did order 2 mains. My husband ordered the Slowly Cooked Salmon with Creamy Favas. I don't  usually order salmon when I go out because to me salmon always tastes the same. This salmon however, had an ultra delicate flavor. It barely tasted like salmon. The fava purée was different & delish. I had the Smoked Pork Confit, Smoked Bacon Marmalade, & Grilled Ramps. What really makes this dish tasty is the ooey gooey marmalade.  With chunks of smoked bacon, how can it not be scrumptious? Ramps are in season but they did not add much to the dish.  Needless to say, we had no room for dessert, even though I was dying to try the caramel sundae. Next time!Service was friendly enough. Some dishes came right away and some we had to wait longer for.  The decor is absolutely lovely & different; you really have to see it!Since the menu is seasonal, some of the dishes I was hoping to try (like the Suckling Pig!),?were not available. Still, although, everything was not perfect, most dishes were original, delicious, & on point....a great experience.  I welcome a chance to return to try the other dishes!"

Kate N.,"Long Island City, Queens, NY",7/18/2016,4 star rating,"My bf and I went there for my birthday. Amex concierge made reservation for us so we didn't deal with that. We started with drinks at the bar. My drink Ginger Margarita was awesome! The space looks hip. It is large, busy and buzzy, great for a happy hour hang. Our table was ready shortly and we were planted in the middle of the myriad of small tables for two. Dates were everywhere :)Our appetizers: crab toast - A MUST! Tuna sashimi - great! Snap pea salad - goodEntrees: Sea bass - good Fried chicken - great! A bite of the burger - great!!Desert:Sundae - fun and delicious!Service was great up until the after desert. Our waiter disappeared for 45 minutes. We finally got a manager to get the check. Overall great experience but I prefer smaller quieter places."
Tristan P.,"Boonton, NJ",10/24/2018,4 star rating,"Really beautiful restaurant with lots of space and a nice big bar. I was there with a group of four and we were able to get some appetizers to all share along with a few entrées that we all nibbled at. The fried chicken is absolutely delicious, and is single-handedly one of the reasons that I plan to return. The yummy cocktails are great as well. The restaurant wasn't too crazy at 5 PM on a weeknight, but you may look to book a reservation for more popular nights."
Kayla C.,"New York, NY",12/29/2019,3 star rating,"Brunch: we had the crab toast (delicious), and the scrambled eggs & potatoes, and scrambled eggs & oysters. Portion sizes were a lil small (not enough to feed this hungry hoe.) And it was a bit expensive for a pretty average brunch. The service was GREAT though, Jocelyn was really nice & attentive. However, it took us a while to be seated and the hosts were abrupt. Also, Google Maps is wrong. You can find the restaurant below abc carpet & home."
Valerie V.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",4/5/2021,5 star rating,"It was amazing. All the food we had was great quality and great taste. But pricey, but it is worth it!"
Romina R.,"New York, NY",9/1/2016,5 star rating,Delicious and fabulous ambiance! We loved the crab toast and calamari must try! The burger was good but I probably wouldn't try it again. The service was fantastic. I would come back to try more menu items.
Jennie C.,"Chicago, IL",5/30/2016,4 star rating,"Beautiful spacious restaurant. We ordered eggs Benedict and French toast with coffee. Was bummed to get skim milk again to pair with my coffee (what's wrong with you, NYC?), but in their defense the coffee didn't need any milk as it was quite good. The server was a bit slow in refilling though, seems they won't automatically do so. The dishes looked deceptively simple but once I cut into my French toast I was amazed at how crispy it was on the outside and how custardy and light it was on the inside. Thought they were a bit stingy with the apples (3 meager pieces for a $19 French toast) but I guess that NYC norm? Anyways it was delicious, so much so I didn't bother to taste the eggs Benedict. Liked the farm to table focus and would happily return to try other dishes."
Olivia S.,"New York, NY",6/13/2014,5 star rating,"Came here early morning for brunch with one if my girlfriends & had a fantastic meal from beginning to end.The crab toast was amazing. Massive bits of crab meat on a buttered piece of baguette. Buttery, smooth & fresh w/ a bit of lemon juice. Refreshing & perfect for a hot summer day.And that carrot & avocado salad?! Wow, it leaves a bang in you mouth! Slices of deliciously creamy avocado slices with sweet yet spicy carrots. Amazing (& not to mention fresh!).The ravioloo was a special that i'm glad I ordered. I'd eat over & over again if it wasn't so filling. Egg yolk & ricotta cheese enveloped in a large piece of ravioli. Once I sliced it w/ the edge of my fork, the yolk started ozzing out in golden perfection. And w/ that sauteed kale & shredded pork??? BAM! Perfection served on you place fo'sho.The salted caramel sundae was a bit too sweet for me. Great for splitting w/ a friend since it consists of 3 scoops of ice cream sprinkled w/ candied peanuts & popcorn and drizzled w/ chocolate syrup.I love the open space of ABC Kitchen. It's simply decorated like an outdoor patio yet it's elegant & beautiful. Perfect for groups & dates. And the farm to table concept is what I love about this place!Our waiter was amazing with service. He did not lead to any disappointments.Sure it's a bit pricey. But everything on the menu is worth it! And the service too.Jean George does it again. Oh yeah!"
Friya B.,"New York, NY",2/27/2017,5 star rating,"This restaurant is the perfect place for a boozy brunch with its ambiance and energetic environment. When visiting friends in New York City, we decided to have brunch at this restuarant and it was wonderful. I ordered the blood orange bellini (amazing) and the pomegranate bellini is also exceptionally good. I also highly recommend the eggs Benedict. They are truly delicious and savory. Incredibly memorable."
Sam X.,"New York, NY",3/18/2018,1 star rating,"So this just happened, me and my friends went to ABC Kitchen to get an afternoon drink, we entered the bar and there weren't enough chairs for 3 of us, the bar wasn't busy and there were empty chairs on the other side of the bar, so we moved ONE chair from the other side of the bar to another side so all 3 of us can sit. Soon as we sat down and ready to order, a white waitress walked to us and told us we can't move chairs at the bar, so I said ""ok, sorry"" while I saw there were a couple behind her taking three chairs with one chair for her purse. So I asked the waitress if she could ask the lady to take her purse and give us the chair. The waitress refused and said: "" Sorry no, we have to have 6 chairs at the bar"" and took the chair away. We didn't want to make a scene so we grabbed our things and walked out, but I think i need to voice out the uncomfortable experience we received from the staff at ABC Kitchen, i don't want to call her a racist but it was clear that other white customers moved around chairs and she rather let the other white lady to put her purse on another chair than give it to us to sit. Being a popular restaurant in NYC, ABC kitchen really need to reassess the quality of service they provide to customers. Until then, I will not feel comfortable return to this place."
Yen-Yi H.,"Brookline, MA",3/18/2018,1 star rating,"Me and my friends were there for an afternoon drink, but it turned out to be an unpleasant experience. My friend grabbed a chair from the other side of the bar to accommodate the sitting ( we got 3 people but there were only 2 chairs available at the windows side). However, the waitress came to us and said, you can't grab the chair from the table cuz we have particular arrangement for the sitting). Then I asked that waitress if she could gently ask a couple, who were sitting around the bar to give the chair to us, where she had her purse on, and she said No. Wait a minute, was she insinuating that she would rather have the the purse own the seat than giving us one more chair? I'm sure she didn't want to come off as a racist, but I don't feel comfortable about this experience."
Kane P.,"Glen Cove, NY",12/30/2018,4 star rating,"This was my first time eating at ABC kitchen and won't be my last.My girlfriend and I didn't make a reservation and just decided to walk in when they opened since we were in the neighborhood. We figured we could just sit at the bar but we were lucky enough to score a table. The staff was lovely and seated us promptly.The simplistic and earthy approach to the restaurant was well balanced. The decor complimented the menu perfectly.We really appreciated the personal touch that you got from the staff, they made you feel like you were their only table. It was great to see that they were all knowledgeable and comfortable with the menu, they provided educated answers and recommendations about the food and wine.We started with the meat and cheese platter, simple but lovely. They weren't trying to do to much, quality cheese and meats.Then we got the beets and butter dish. I appreciated the different beets but would have preferred some of the beets to be pickled to help cut through the fattiness of the butter. Additionally I felt there wasn't enough differentiation between the three butters. The wood fired lobster paired with the broccoli rabe  was fantastic and I was very impressed with the portion size considering the price. Overall a lovely experience and would highly recommend this to anyone looking for simplistic fine dining."
Kristina P.,"New York, NY",12/14/2016,4 star rating,"Okay, last night I visited ABC Kitchen for a second time and I still feel the same as the first- good but not amazing. Service is friendly, cocktails are delicious and dangerously drinkable (I could guzzle down 10,000 vodka thyme lemonades), and I think the menu's strong suit is definitely the appetizers/small plates. We shared the crab toast, kale salad, apple salad, ravioli, and pretzel dusted calamari to start and everything was sooo good. But the entree menu didn't impress me. I ordered the salmon again (I got this last time and it came out v v v rare). I asked for it well done and it was cooked correctly this time, but the dish itself was a little bland. Idk what it was missing but I've definitely had better fish. ABC is no doubt a solid option but if you're looking for something really ""wow"" this isn't it."
Nancy F.,"Hopatcong, NJ",6/24/2016,4 star rating,"Beautiful restaurant!I love the interior design that went into this place and how it gives off this rustic vintage look. I came by for brunch after it was recommended to me by a friend and the atmosphere didn't disappoint! It's definitely on the pricy side and I would BEWARE of what kind of water to get! I'm knocking off a star because $7 for WATER is INSANE. Do yourself a favor and just go with the tap. I would come back but only for the atmosphere and french toast. I went with my boyfriend and somehow the bill came out unbelievably high. What broke the bank was the 2 mimosas we ordered ($36), and the 2 waters (selzar, filtered $14). Nice place but beware of the hidden prices!"
Irina P.,"New York, NY",8/12/2016,5 star rating,"Great, trendy ambiance and very attentive staff made for a wonderful experience. But what made this a 5 star restaurant for me was the food. We had the lunch prefix which was absolutely amazing! I had the kale salad which was fresh and very nicely dressed, not drowning in dressing but also not dry. Made me really enjoy eating healthy. I do, however, regret a bit not getting the tuna sashimi, which bursted with flavor! Amazingly fresh, and sitting in a mixture of salty, nutty, zesty goodness, it sent my tastebuds in euphoria. My girlfriend opted for the portobello sandwich which as also busting with flavor but I think I did better in the main course round by ordering the raviolo. It was a hot summer day so I was a bit concerned about being overwhelmed by the richness of the pork ragu but I still went for it. And it was amazing- the perfectly textured raviolo had a runny yolk in it which coated the tender pork ragu making every bite absolute perfection! We ended our meal with the almond cake, which was yummy, and the salted caramel sundae topped with crunchy popcorn. The sundae was insane! It was so good I felt like it should be illegal! We also shared a beautiful bottle of Sauvignon Blanc, and I think for a lunch menu, there were plenty of options- both by the bottle and by the glass.I can't wait to return here and try the dinner menu!"
Joanne K.,"Los Angeles, CA",5/7/2016,5 star rating,"FARM TO TABLE! SAFE AND SEASONAL! LOCAL AND GMO-FREE! COUNT ME IN! I love the they are eco-conscious! They eco-friendly/ 100% recycled napkins in the restroom! YAY!Michelin chef Jean-Georges and his family was sitting in the table right next to us. After trying this restaurant, I must try anything else he has his name on! My cousin got this reservation 30 days in advance of the day he was visiting. We were able to get a 5:30 pm on a Sunday and it wasn't too crowded. There's a 10-15 minute window where it's okay to be late.. DECOR: There's three main parts to this restaurant! The bar/waiting area, the dimly lit dinning area, and the walk-in/casual area. Decor was gorgeous! There's plants everywhere! Some of the decor pieces include a chandelier and a victorian bookcase. The walk-in/casual area has a bar and a beautiful staircase. SERVICE: I had a crush on our waiter because she was SO SO eloquent and knowledgable about the menu. She gave us lot of great recommendations with thorough descriptions. We also had a waiter that cleaned the plates after we were done eating. He was also so nice and added to our overall experience. DRINKS: She recommended the basil lime daiquiri, the fruity drink that girls would love! My cousin got the mezcal lavender paloma. It has this smoky flavor to it. My friend also go the vodka thyme lemonade, also sweet and delicious! FOOD: Soft Shell Crab was the seasonal special! I would recommend it if it's around May/Spring Season. It was fried, crunchy, and soft on the inside. It laid over a bed of spring greens, radish slices, asparagus. Our waiter recommended the Roast Carrot and Avocado salad, crunchy seeds, sour cream, citrus. The sauce on this was divine. The carrots were heavenly~ and sweet like how they usually are when they're cooked. Crispy pork confit, smoked bacon marmalade and braised turnips! That crispiness on the confit is unforgettable yummy. Mushroom, parmesan, oregano, and farm egg. The consistency on the egg white was a little runny but mmm I do love a mushroom pizza. The mushrooms were a good size on the slices. 2 appetizers, 1 whole wheat pizza, and 1 entree was pretty filling for 3 people. But there's always room for dessert! We got the Basil and Mint Panna cotta with Meyer Lemon Sorbet! The Panna Cotta was soft and light. It came out looking like an egg because of the thinly sliced lemon on top. The lemon sorbet was a good palette cleanser and keep your mouth guessing. Will I get the tart sorbet or the creamy panna cotta this time. P.S. They have a gender neutral bathroom!"
Jaime N.,"TriBeCa, Manhattan, NY",11/14/2018,5 star rating,My friends and I had a great time at ABC. We were celebrating our friend's birthday and very much enjoyed it.

A great place to get with large group of friends - we will be back!* crab toast* main lobster* strozzapreti* broccoli rabe* black sea bass
Leen A.,"New York, NY",12/11/2018,5 star rating,"I really enjoyed this spot! the servers were all very welcoming and sweet. The food made everything better. We had the roasted carrot and avocado salad, the crab toast, and mushroom pizza. I can't decide if i like the salad or the pizza more. The salad had a very authentic taste to it. It remainder me of a middle eastern dish. There was a great vibe in the place dimmed lights and nice decor."
Marta D.,"New York, NY",9/8/2016,5 star rating,"Picked this spot for a dinner date last night since its farm to table mostly organic local food. Couldn't be happier with the choice. At first it was a little hard to find the restaurant because it doesn't have a huge banner like other restaurants do. Once I entered, I fell in love with the ambience of the place. I felt as if I was in Williamsburg rather than the city, and the decor was very beautiful. Once we sat down I noticed that the place gets a little loud but it's not hard to speak at all.My boyfriend and I ordered the kale salad, tuna sashimi, and lobster and an almond Pena cotta. So many good items on the menu that we had a hard time picking something out, so we asked the waitress to help us. She pretty much made the decision for us and we couldn't have been happier. The dessert was very fluffy and light and all the food was top notch, it also came out fairly quickly. We took a sneak peak at the table next to us and we saw a whole wheat pizza which we are definitely coming back for. Overall an amazing experience and great service !Take a look at my lobster and Penna cotta pics. FYI the picture is only of half the lobster cause my boyfriend and I split the dish."
Crystal P.,"New York, NY",11/21/2018,5 star rating,"We booked a large group dinner here for my birthday. Quick response, and very easy booking process. We chose from a list of items for each course and everything was amazing. For market table we got squash toast, crab toast, and roasted beets. My favorite were the two roasts but the beets were also great. For apps we got roasted carrot salad, kale salad, calamari, and ricotta. My favorite was the carrot salad. For entrees we got ravioli, salmon, fried chicken, and pork chop. The best was the fried chicken and salmon. For dessert, we finished off with chocolate cake, almond cake, and sundae. If you can, get all three! They were all so amazing and so different in their own way. Can't wait to come back!"
Yuqing L.,"New York, NY",2/9/2017,4 star rating,"Beautiful restaurant. Recommend coming at day time as the decorations are mostly in white-looking natural. Great ambience. Have many seats inside but you won't feel too packed or hear too loud noise. Healthy food. Service was okay. Servers were too busy to carefully catering each table, which also left some privacy for me and my husband. Vegetarians should check this place. I am a meat lover, so I find the dishes here are too light for me. With that being said, the food tastes good anyway. I enjoyed the dinner. Price was fair. $150 for two, no alcohol, excluding tip and tax."
Susing Y.,"New York, NY",2/18/2019,5 star rating,"I recently came here for brunch on a Saturday morning with my boyfriend. We ordered the buttermilk pancakes with lemon curd and scrambled eggs, crispy oyster and hot sauce butter. Both dishes were delicious! The lemon curd was perfect - not too sweet and not too tart! Customer service was outstanding and everyone was so friendly. I love the ambiance and interior decor of the restaurant.I would definitely come back here again!I would recommend making a reservation."
Taylor G.,"New York, NY",11/10/2016,5 star rating,"Came here this evening for a special night out with family in town, and we were worried it would be too busy to get even close to this trendy place. However, we were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and were seated immediately at a small cocktail table towards the front-no waiting AND still got access to the full menu and beautiful interior.I can't say enough good things about the experience-the food was INCREDIBLE-I'm not the biggest fan of calamari, but the pretzel-crushed version here is an absolute must.The very best part of our five star experience was easily the service, however. Everyone was friendly, accommodating, and genuinely cared about our evening. I won't hesitate to come back very soon!!"
Roselle B.,"Aiea, HI",3/5/2019,4 star rating,walking in you feel like you're in a designer home like the ones that the famous HGTV couples designed and made lol. beautiful interior! decor is homey and inviting. the food is absolutely delicious! great selections. yes definitely on the pricey side though. the one thing that really stuck out to me is their apple pie. best one i've had ever! but seems like it's seasonal because i went back couple of times and it's not on menu anymore. i just feel bad for anyone who didn't try it! haha. definitely recommend this place. you'll have a great experience.
Secil A.,"Manhattan, NY",11/27/2018,5 star rating,Always a pleasant experience! I always get their roasted carrot and avocado salad to start with when I go there. The dressing can be a little salty (so I try to not forget to order it on the side) but both the carrot and avocados in the salad taste great with the dressing. I know their pizzas are very famous (and I've tried it it's delicious) but I really like their black sea bass. My friend had the ricotta ravioli that she really liked as well. The service was quick and the complimentary bread they bring is also very delicious. Highly recommend!
Shalane K.,"St. Petersburg, FL",5/1/2019,5 star rating,"It took a while for me to snag a Saturday night dinner reservation, but it was well worth the wait! I had the fried chicken over greens with hot sauce butter. The serving size was very generous, chicken was tender and juicy covered in a panko-like coating, and the hot sauce butter perfectly balanced out the dish. The atmosphere was pretty and upscale without being pretentious. ABC Kitchen is a new favorite!"
Jay K.,"New York, NY",11/22/2016,5 star rating,"Love this place. ABC is also known for their furniture company which I love as well. Had their crab toast which was absolutely delicious and the bass as my entree-phenomenal. Service was a bit slow, but all-in-all, great experience as always. This is one of my favorite farm-to-table restaurants. Great for lunch and dinner. Try making reservations few days ahead as their availability runs out quickly if you try to make it on the same day you want to go. i'd say the dress code can be business casual, but no strict dress code."
Nur J.,"Brooklyn, NY",11/19/2016,5 star rating,"Another great restaurant by Chef Jean-Gorges Vongerichten. Completely whimsical, environmentally conscious, and it's farm-to-table! Crab toast lemon aioli is tantalizing - it still makes my mouth water when I think of it. The fried organic chicken was tender and moist - lightly battered. Really complemented by the hot sauce. The kasha bow tie pasta with veal meatballs was good but needed a little more sauce - seemed to be a bit dry. The meatballs were amazing though. The mushrooms, Parmesan, oregano and farm pizza was interesting. It lacked a bit of flavor. With a $22 price tag - your expectation is obviously higher. After completely filling up our bellies with the above, we still ordered the sundae with salted caramel ice cream, candied peanuts & popcorn to conclude the bf's birthday celebration. It was truly decadent but worth every calorie. Overall,it was a great night embellished by the romantic ambiance."
Marco H.,"Brooklyn, NY",6/25/2018,4 star rating,"The fiod quality is so good .. Crap toast ,chicken liver toast..( appetizers) are amazing , entrees are very good quality mushroom pizza and sausage pasta.. Just the service is Little slow .. atmosphere is great and elegant"
Becky C.,"Great Neck, NY",5/27/2019,5 star rating,You walk into the doors and a beautiful space with candles and flowers awaits for you! We made a reservation and got seated right away. The food came out pretty quickly one by one. Since we were sharing it felt like a course meal. Every one of them were so good. They also use organic or locally produced ingredients. Don't forget to get the sundae for dessert even though you are full! It is the right amount of sweetness.
George H.,"Manhattan, NY",4/23/2018,1 star rating,"This was an incredibly bad experience. We had reserved for 2 PM, but were told when we arrived that there would be at least a 45 minute delay. There were at least 15 to 20 people standing around waiting for their tables to open up. We canceled and went over to the Union Square Café, where we had an excellent lunch.I can only say that there must've been some kind of terrible glitch in the reservation system."
Anusha T.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",8/17/2018,4 star rating,It is an absolute delight to dine here every time! I came here to get a quick lunch with my husband. The place is rustic and inviting. I love how the food translates into the space. It is interconnected and makes sense. We had a reservation and were shown to our tables promptly. Our host was very polite and answered all the questions I had for him. We got started of with a basil lemon soda and a gin based cocktail. They were very good. We got the heirloom tomatoes and the cucumber coconut soup which was also very fresh and rustic. For the entrees we got the salmon and the veggie burger. The salmon however was a little overdone and the veggie burger was decent. We ended our meal with an almond panna cotta which was perfect. This is a place to come to get a meal which focuses on making the fresh market produce shine.
Nick Z.,"New York, NY",10/10/2016,4 star rating,"Great restaurant for a nice date or dinner with friends. They definitely focus on the freshness and deliciousness of the produce. we found that the proteins were a little lacking in comparison.  Space is dimly lit but well decorated and modern. Like any other restaurant in New York space is tight but the restaurant makes you feel comfortable and it's cozy enough. We had the mushroom pizza and fish course both of which were good. The pizza has mushrooms, truffle oil, a fried egg and some other things that all make it a delicious umami bomb. Fish was a little overcooked and not particularly flavorful but the greens and tomato saved it.Expect to spend about $50 per person if you get a couple things. Great fresh food, particularly anything veggie. Not sure the service is up to par for the nice restaurant tier they're in. A little slow getting people's attention, no check ins, small stuff like that is lacking."
Caitlin R.,"Brooklyn, NY",2/8/2016,2 star rating,"Service is great, people are very friendly and welcoming. Food is always good, so why am I only giving them 2 stars?The portion size.As you can see from the picture, same dish, different year. The top picture is from today, 5 sad, lonely and small oysters sitting on the eggs. The bottom on is from 2012, there were at least 11 plump oysters in the plate. The pictures says it all. I know there's inflation but come on, this is a huge difference.I feel like I'm being cheated."
Aimee X.,"New York, NY",2/19/2016,4 star rating,"I've heard so many great things about ABC Kitchen that I was more excited than my bf when I took him there for his birthday. I was thoroughly impressed with the decor and how true they adhered to the farm-to-table concept. The food was simple and delicious but not very inventive. I also found the huge list of suppliers in the back of the menu to be pretty hilarious like where the table and plates came from and and the pork and the veggies. It's almost mockingly detailed.Appetizer: At the recommendation of our waiter, we ordered the crab toast with lemon aioli. The crab tasted very fresh but overall the dish was a little too salty for my taste. The lemon aioli was also a little overpowering for the crab. Entree: I ordered the ricotta ravioli with tomato sauce which was delicate and light. The raviolis were filled to the brim with ricotta and the acidity of the tomato sauce cut through the rich cheese very nicely. Very simple but done with quality ingredients. Dessert: We ordered the spiced pumpkin creme brulee with pomegranate sorbet to share. For me, this was the highlight of the meal. The creme brulee was perfectly creamy and sweet with a nice crunchy top. The pomegranate sorbet was tart and went perfectly with the pumpkin spice. Overall, cool concept and meal experience. Food wise, was very delicious but not mind-blowing. For all the hype and price, I honestly expected more."
Lillian C.,"New York, NY",3/9/2016,4 star rating,"This is an upscale, healthy restaurant. Regarding food, get the crab toast as it was delicious and I heard rave reviews about the carrots & avocado salad. The sea bass entree was prepared well - healthy but very flavorful. I found service a bit lacking. When I first walked in on Friday at 6pm, they quoted me 40 min wait time. But when I asked again 5 min later, they ended up seating us immediately. I saw a bunch (over 10) of empty tables, and they were still empty when we left! My party of 2 was placed at a communal table that we were supposed to share with another party. My friend who was there the same evening said they seated her on a countertop area, despite all the empty tables. Even though we didn't make reservations (""all booked"" on opentable) they should let us enjoy our dining experience!!"
Kemi O.,"Manhattan, NY",12/30/2017,4 star rating,"ABC Kitchen is one of those NYC must try restaurants (we have plenty of those).Come for the food, which is pretty good, or come for the sights,  you never know who or what you might see!But one thing is for sure,  you'll have a good time doing one of the two."
Caela I.,"Boston, MA",1/5/2020,5 star rating,"Had the most magical lunch at ABC Kitchen with my husband and best friend. Entered the restaurant through the decor store entrance which was a delight since I later found out they sold all their dish ware at the store (very pricey though). Ambiance was absolutely amazing, dim light but not too dark! Service was exceptional, and food was delicious and fresh! We knew going in price point would be up there, but the lunch menu was reasonable and food portions were perfect (came with appetizer, entree, and dessert). I had such a good experience I can hardly wait to return and try them out for dinner!"
Hadiza A.,"Brooklyn, NY",10/22/2016,5 star rating,"So! I had the ricotta and fig, tuna sashimi, beets and yogurt as appetizers: all superbe. Vraiment, truly delectable. The ricotta was a rich buttery delight, beautifully complemented by the fig. This and the excellent olive oil are why I had too much bread. Also, wet plates should leave the table dry when everything is so delicious. The tuna was delicately seasoned with ginger and mint. It was like tasting tuna for the first time- as I've been on a baby-on-board hiatus.The sea bass presented over wilted greens in broth was excellent. The broth was clean and clear and why I had ALL the bread. This restaurant's food is note perfect and without pretension. My husband had the salmon and because he is a food-silly man who only eats three vegetables, I had his red cabbage and horseradish and it provided a side that gave interesting bite to my entrée. I also ordered the mashed potatoes which were sublime. I ate abundantly and without shame because I make milk and need sustenance. Dessert was an almond cake that was delectably balanced by an apple sorbet and a poached pear stuffed with some kind of sweet surprise.We had two bottles of Oregon (I think) wine that the French at the table ordered and we universally agreed were delicious.Baby decided to display her recently discovered vocal prowess but the ambience in the restaurant is the kind that absorbs high pitched noise. We were able to eat guilt free and without disturbing our neighbouring diners. Service was attentive, constant and just visible enough. The decor is an enchanting mix of industrial meets antique with a farmer's market in a newyork bar vibe. Pricy but 10/10 would do again. And again."
Merisa H.,"New York, NY",7/13/2018,4 star rating,"I went to ABC kitchen for dinner with some friends. The place has a really cool vibe. It is rustic-chic, with dim lighting and a cozy feel. It would be a great place for a date. We started with a bottle of rose at the counter top by the window, while we waited for out table to be ready.  The rose was perfect after the humidity that was present that day.When we were seated, they brought bread. The bread was cold and stiff. It was pretty hard to chew through, so I would pass on this. Wait for the food itself! For starters we got the ricotta, tuna, and roasted beets. All were super fresh. You could actually taste each ingredient in its perfect form. The ricotta was my favorite! It is housemate and came with a sweet berry sauce. It was just overall incredible! But I loved all three of these things, so I would recommend all (but the ricotta is a must-get).We also had the goat cheese pizza, the roasted carrot salad, and the fried string beans. The goat cheese pizza was a little too charred for my liking, and it didn't have enough goat cheese. It was mostly kale and red pepper flake. The roasted carrot salad was delicious! Very light and refreshing. The string beans were also delightful, a bit greasy, but overall great.We also had the infamous popcorn Sunday for dessert (I had to get it after everyone talked about it on here). It was very disappointing. It was just bland and nothing special. The popcorn was also a little stale. I would pass on this, despite what you may have heard!Overall, great place. Get the ricotta!"
Heather S.,"San Francisco, CA",10/18/2016,5 star rating,"Two words: Crab Toast.Seriously I could just order 3 of those and call it a day. I also loved the salmon. Their menu changes every now and then and it's great. I am also a huge fan of JG's Mercer Kitchen so it's nice to see some overlap of some of the dishes like the ricotta. I'm also always a fan of the bread. I love that the store is right there as well and great to shop in when waiting. I had their panna cotta w/ my fiance and let me just say it was an explosion of flavors in  my mouth. There was sweet, tarte, spicy, etc. My taste buds were freaking out in a good way. This will always be one of my favorite spots."
Greg P.,"Wrentham, MA",4/10/2019,5 star rating,Had dinner here with a group of people from work and had a truly fantastic experience.   The six of us shared a variety of appetizers all of which were spectacular.  Great flavors - both expected and unexpected.  Service was friendly and helpful but never intrusive.  The ginger margarita tastes very fresh.  I'd highly recommend it.  Pork chop entree was really flavorful and cooked perfectly.   Place is on the noisier side but has a very lively vibe which made it ok.  Original plan was to go somewhere else.  I'm very happy that the plan changed!
Lou M.,"Manhattan, NY",2/22/2016,5 star rating,"Food should be top 10 in New York.Ambiance amazing.Market table:Housemade ricotta, cranberry compote and grilled bread - the combo of ricotta and cranberry creates an explosion in your mouth.  If you don't get this then you are missing out on the whole experience Crab toast:  can't go wrong getting this dishAppetizer:Tuna sashimi - good but wouldn't say it's wowPizza: mushroom Parmesan oregano and farm egg -  not badEntree:  at this point we were fullOrganic chicken -  decent size, tender, and flavorful"
Joyce W.,"Boston, MA",5/31/2016,3 star rating,"Overhyped. Underwhelming.We came on a Thursday night with reservations. Located in the ABC Home store, the restaurant has a really chic, romantic atmosphere.The food, however, was mediocre. The ONLY standout dish we had was the crab toast. If you must come, get the toast. Light, refreshing, and deliciously seafood-y fresh with the perfect combo of lemon and aioli. We also got the pasta with veal meatballs - the sauce was overly sweet and the meatballs had a good texture but were a little too salty. The asparagus, bacon, ricotta pizza was alright, nothing really worth talking about. We also got the salmon w/spicy carrot sauce. This dish was also just mediocre, and a little overpriced for it as well.Sidenote, the cocktails were tasty though! Though for a Jean-George restaurant it's a little disappointing to say that the highlights was an appetizer and the drinks. Definitely don't need to come again. Sorry not sorry Jean-George!"
Rachel P.,"New York, NY",8/22/2019,5 star rating,Took my friend from out of state here and we both had a great time. Would recommend making a reservation ahead of time and showing up on time as they are quite strict with their rsvp policy. The carrot/avocado salad was simple yet delicious and worth the hype. Also the mushroom pizza was a great size for us to split. It's the kind of dinner place that makes you want to go a second time to try completely different things because the whole menu looks amazing. Cocktails were unique and expensive - didn't love mine. Waitress was friendly and helpful with suggestions but kinda disappeared after we ordered/got our food.

Kristen Q.,"Torrance, CA",3/31/2014,3 star rating,"Score! I really wanted to try this restaurant and I called 4x for reservations; each time they said they were fully committed. We went there and it was only a 20-min wait for a table when we arrived at 7pm on a Thursday night. Fully committed? Hmm...The rundown: in short, it's only worth ordering the duck confit and crab toast. All the other dishes are okay or I've had better. I'm a bit of a snob since I've had the opportunity to go to a lot of fancy schmancy restaurants like Eleven Madison Park, Park Avenue [insert season here], etc.Sea bass: not that flavorful; I prefer Chilean sea bass... is Chilean sea bass just more moist and tender in general so it's an unfair comparison?Butternut squash: it's okay; I can make the same quality myselfBrussel sprouts: uhhh, these were charred/burnt! Almond cake: okay, but not incredibly moistMushroom pizza: this was good!Raw scallops: nice presentation but I'm not a fan of raw like raw oysters, dislike! I like my oysters cooked. yes, I'm a rarity.Sea salt caramel sundae: YUM! Pretty darn originalBig Apple cocktail: it was okay; I like more fruity drinks like my lychee soju, my all-time favorite or a pineapple malibu. Why do all drinks nowadays have ginger? I liked that their drink list had fresh organic blended fruits/veggies juices!"

Peter N.,"Brooklyn, NY",3/16/2016,4 star rating,"I came here for lunch to meet with my account manager at Salesforce -- lo' and behold, it was an old friend & colleague from my days at Gilt. She recommended this place which I've never been to (but have been meaning too, since ABC Kitchen is like a god damn institution); but there's always been some younger, new, buzzier restaurant every week that steals my attention away from the classics. I walk through the antique-looking French doors and am greeted by a triad of employees grinning asking me if I have a reservation (of course). I tried to score a seat by the bar windows because you know... I wanted to take pictures of food bathed in natural light... but alas they don't serve food there so I frustratingly sat down at a table with my account manager like a civilized individual. There was a hanging light immediately above me so no overhead shots unless I wanted half my body to cast a shadow.Because my friend/account manager was working on her wedding body and I, my Fire Island body, we opted for the Lemon Thyme soda for $7 instead of the Clementine Mojito for $16. For starters we ordered the crab toast with lemon aioli ($16), roast carrot and avocado salad ($17) and shaved raw fluke with marinated apples and mint ($19). The crab toast was phenomenal, light, and meaty. You definitely got bang for your buck. The roast carrot and avocado salad is award winning and was pre-split into two dishes for us (thanks!), and it was mind blowing good. If rabbit food could taste this good always, I'd be a vegetarian. Lastly, the fluke was fluke. It was good but not as good as the first two.For entrees we ordered black sea bass with chilies and herbs on a bed of spinach ($32) and my friend the roasted hake with crunchy potatoes, broccoli, and red-chili garlic sauce ($32). The dishes were solid but not as sublime as the starters. Don't get me wrong, the sea bass was great, and the hake executed perfectly but I prefer really bold flavors which moreso came from the crab toast than from my entrees. For some reason I expected a whole fish to be placed in front of me, probably because of my asian upbringing but remembered I'm in a fine dining establishment so it was decent portion.I didn't get a chance to order dessert because at this point, this one hour midday work lunch had turned into nearly two hours. I would've ordered dessert had it not taken a decade between the starters and the main course. I was eyeballing the cookie plate for $10 and the basil & mint panna cotta with meyer lemon sorbet for $12.Lunch is packed by the way, make a reservation. My friend had to flag down a diff. waiter and give him the card because ours was busy running around with his head cut off serving the other needy tables. Thanks for the delicious lunch Salesforce, I expect Gramercy Tavern next... and shout out to the homies at the table next to us, an eight-top that showed up in cowboy boots and cowboy hats."
Karen H.,"Corona, NY",6/16/2016,4 star rating,"One of the best places I eaten in NYC. The place is packed but the staff do not seem overwhelm and they do not rush you! Happy with the service!Me and my friends ordered1) toast crab aioli - 5/52) fried calamari - 5/53) mushroom pizza - 5/5 4) akaushi cheeseburger- 4.5/55) sundae salted caramel ice cream 3/5 Everything was impressively delicious except the cheeseburger and the ice cream sundae . The cheeseburger was better than most cheeseburger I eaten in nyc but I will not come back for it next time. The salted caramel was a love or hate dish,  one friend loved it and the other one just straight did not like it. Although it's a very creative dessert dish that it's not find in most places so it is worthy to give it a try!"
Anthony M.,"Austin, TX",6/3/2018,5 star rating,"Heard many great things about ABC Kitchen, so I knew I had to try it out. When walking in at night you will find it to be a nice low-lit environment - perfect for a family dinner or date. II shared two entrees: the Asparagus Pizza and the Fried Chicken. Wow! The asparagus was tasty. Light on the stomach and has a unique flavor - definitely a good option if you want something healthier. The fried chicken was amazing as well. It was very crispy while still being nice and tender on the inside. The sauce that it came with was sweet and spicy; it went perfectly well. The service was great, the prices were fair, and overall I left highly satisfied."
Wen Jin G.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",1/9/2016,5 star rating,"i loved this place!we came here for a company christmas dinner and really enjoyed our experience from the moment we came in to the moment we left.  we had a group of 15+ ppl and chose the prix-fixed menu ahead of time.  we got to share market table items, apps, sides, desserts, and each person get to pick their own entree.  i think for the price and quality, it's an excellent deal.so here's what we ate and drank:-roasted kabocha squash toast:  i love kabocha squash!  ABC's version featured sweet roasted kabocha, ricotta, apple cider vinegar on a crispy buttered toast.  it was sweet and savory.-crab toast with lemon aioli:  fresh crab meat topped with lemon aioli, on a buttery toast, it was so fresh and chock-full of crab meat.  it had so much flavor and possibly my favorite from the night, still thinking about it as i write this review.  excellent!-roasted cauliflower, onion and walnut crumbs, fried egg:  tbh, not a huge fan of cauliflowers, but ABC's version wasn't too shabby, the cauliflower was nicely seasoned, the onion/walnut crumbs were tasty!-tuna sashimi marinated with ginger and mint:  the marinade was flavorful and not overpowering, tuna was very fresh.-roast carrot and avocado salad:  the carrots were pickled and roasted, good contrast against the rich and creamy avocado salad.  -pretzel dusted calamari:  crunchy, tender (definitely NOT rubbery), flavorful, this was very good too!-mushrooms, parmesan, oregano, and farm egg pizza:  good earthy, robust mushroom flavor (i love shrooms!), but mushroom mixture was kinda ""wet"" and made the crust soggy.  -wood oven roasted lobster: sweet, tender, succulent, with a squeeze of lemon, we're in business!  i really liked it.-glazed mushroom:  sauteed mushroom, okay, nothing too special. -sundae with salted caramel ice cream:  their signature dessert and i really like the salted caramel ice cream.  it's perfect balance of sweet, creamy, and just a hint of salt.  the candied popcorn was great too.-chocolate cake with malted chocolate ganache:  moist and dense, however, a bit too sweet for my taste.-seasonal doughnuts:  there were three, a cream-filled chocolate glazed doughnut, a raspberry (or strawberry?), and a glazed doughnut.  my favorite is the cream-filled one, vanilla + chocolate glaze = perfection!-ginger margarita:  fruity and a good amount of booze that hits you later.  ;-)-lime and basil daiquiri:  fresh!the service here is impeccable, our plates and glasses were never empty (we had a few bottles of reds and whites, but i couldn't remember the names), food was perfectly seasoned and cooked, the portions were just right, and i left with a very full belly.  overally, possibly my favorite meal of 2015.  :-)"

Qian H.,"Burien, WA",5/11/2016,4 star rating,"My friend raves about this place and swore this was an absolute must when visiting NYC. Super busy even on a Monday night! We hung out by the bar and scooped up 2 seats that opened up. Quick breakdown of what we had: -steamed artichoke with tender greens and spicy oregano sauce: This was pretty yummy. The artichoke was just right. The oregano sauce has interesting flavors. Only complaint was the greens were a little on the salty side. -rhubarb + cheese spread:I forgot the name of this, but this spread had yummy fresh rhubarb spread mixed with cheese, oil, and pepper. It was tangy, sweet, and slightly savory. It was perfect paired with their bread.-kale salad with lemon, Serrano chiles, and mint: I loved our simple this salad was. The kale was so sweet. This was a perfect dish to pair with some of the other stronger flavor dishes we had for the evening. -Pretzel dusted calamari with marinara and mustard aioli: I couldn't really tell that the calamari was coated with pretzel? But it was yummy none the less. Also tasted great in the spicy oregano dip from the steamed artichoke dish! -crab toast with lemon aioli: seriously heavenly. I want to cry just thinking about how I can't have it here in LA. Mouthwatering. Fresh. So sweet. So yummy! I covered in in lemon juice and ahhhhhhh! YOU HAVE TO ORDER THIS. -salted caramel ice cream sundae: Okay, I don't have a huge sweet tooth, but the ice cream is so money! The caramel corn and chocolate drizzle was pretty rich, but the ice cream I would love to eat alone, mmm! I washed everything down with two glasses of ice cold rosé. Our server was also very attentive. I'm looking forward to visiting ABC again. I just hope round 2 will be less packed. Is that even possible?"
Jenny T.,"Brooklyn, NY",12/2/2015,5 star rating,"Reservations are hard if you don't make them way in advance. But I walked in on a Sunday afternoon right when they opened and luckily got a table for two!The place is pretty big. Decor is beautiful! It's romantic, rustic, and antique-y if that's even a word. We shared the crab toast with lemon aioli, the raw bay scallops, and the mushroom parmesan pizza with an egg on top. Also a bottle of rosé because why not.The crab toast was meaty, sweet, and delicious! Makes me wish I didn't share. The raw bay scallops were sweet and fresh, served on top of a big shell. So good! And the pizza was perfect for two- exceptionally cheesy and delicious! Please put an egg on every pizza you order.I'd love to come back for dinner!"
Grant J.,"Manhattan, NY",8/4/2021,3 star rating,"Unfortunately, this place has gone downhill in the last few years. The service and food have both lost their once great quality. I ordered for the table ""all three Market Table"" dishes (there are only three) and the waitress had no idea what I was talking about. She began writing the wrong dishes down, so I repeated ""Market Table,"" to which she replied ""I don't know what dishes those are."" I found that shocking, as the menu is small, and there are only three Market Table dishes. Further, she had no understanding of how to time out our courses, as our entrees were brought to us as we were finishing our appetizers. I do not know if the salmon was fresh, but if it did not clearly taste fresh, that isn't a great sign. The cooks lazily dumped corn everywhere on the dish, which had clearly not been drained enough, so there was water on the dish, which made for an unpleasant presentation. Will not return here."
Kim E.,"Staten Island, Staten Island, NY",2/16/2021,1 star rating,"A colleague of mine who is also a pretty loyal customer put in an order for a cake and was instructed to pick it up at 10 am. Not an issue except that when she went to pick it up the place wasn't open. No one was there. Cake was for a colleague and when we called to see what happened, we were informed that they'd send the cake via DoorDash. Well surprise, they didn't send the cake and now we're sitting here on hold. Completely unprofessional and unacceptable, personally never patronizing this place. Shame on y'all."
Jem S.,"Brooklyn, NY",4/19/2018,5 star rating,"I went to ABC Kitchen for lunch and had a delicious and light prix fixed meal. Moreover, our server was super friendly and patient.The roasted beets with yoghurt were delicious. The beets were lightly salted and drizzled with olive oil and some sort of vinegar.The salmon, ordered medium rare, was seasoned well and came atop a bed of fresh lettuce and veggies. The salad was dressed in a slightly sweet and mustardy dressing that paired well with the salmon.Lastly, the almond cake for dessert was sweet and the tart frozen yoghurt on the side was a good balance of flavours. Ordering an americano as well with the almond cake can help tame the sweetness.I definitely recommend ABC Kitchen."
Levi L.,"Brooklyn, NY",8/1/2018,3 star rating,The decor here is nice. There is a lot of art pieces hanging in this place. The tables here spaced nicely. You def need to make a reservation here. The menu here does not change that often. The food here is good. Every dish that was ordered was delicious and flavorful but the portions is not that big. The pricing is also a bit on the higher side for these small portions. Good place to check out but you might want to limit the amount of visits to the restaurant.

Christine T.,"New York, NY",1/12/2016,4 star rating,"I have heard nothing but amazing things about ABC Kitchen so I had to check out Jean-George's restaurant for myself. To start off, the decor and vibes inside are spectacular. It's spacious and simple yet feels earthy and homey with farmer's market vibe. Here's what we ordered:Appetizers (decided to be carb heavy): 1) roasted kabocha squash toast, fresh ricotta and applecider vinegar- my FAVORITE part of the entire meal, who knew squash toast could be so full of flavor? an absolute must try2) crab toast with lemon aioli3) housemade ricotta, cranberry compote and grilled breadentrees:1) fettucine, caramelized brussels sprouts and basil-pistachio pesto- my favorite of all the entrees we got because pesto is the besto2) spinach, goat cheese and herbs pizza3) akaushi cheeseburger with herbed mayo and pickled jalapenosside: roasted brussels sprouts, smoked bacon and pears- this was a nice surprise because it was on the house and we didn't order it but thank god someone was feeling giving because they were SO good The waiter was incredibly friendly/knowledgable of the food/drink menu. He began describing the wine special of the night and created imagery of drinking the wine as sitting by a river smelling freshly shaved pencils, the list goes on of all the beautiful pictures he painted in my mind. The food was wonderful, the ambience was beautiful and relaxing, and the service was great. ABC Kitchen- you were quite the experience and I'm definitely coming back to try out the rest of the amazing menu."
Gaurang G.,"New York, NY",4/6/2019,5 star rating,Amazing restaurant! Must have:1. Ricotta cheese with grilled bread2. Ricotta ravioli 3.

Creighton R.,"Omaha, NE",8/31/2018,4 star rating,Grabbed a little bite to eat here for lunch. The ambiance really set the tone for what would be a great lunch.

Monica M.,"Los Angeles, CA",4/29/2018,4 star rating,"A solid place for a nice dinner. It's always busy though so make reservations ahead of time!Over the years, my favorite thing is still the roast carrot and avocado salad.

Sandee T.,"New York, NY",1/22/2017,4 star rating,"The ambiance and service are the wow factors of ABC Kitchen. Warm and stellar service/reception from the moment we entered til the moment we left, 3 hours later. The decor is perfect; simple, elegant, and super cozy (especially on this very cold January day). I was early so I sat at the bar for a bit and enjoyed a delicious cup of coffee. Yes, coffee. Straight up. And it was satisfying and so good.On cue and on time, my lunch date arrived and we were escorted to our lovely table, but not before passing Meg Ryan-a very good omen, indeed. I'll have what Sally's having...please. Pretzel dusted calamari to start. And a very good one. It was a generous enough appetizer serving but you'll want it all for yourself. It's all good because I followed up with the spicy-crispy shrimp salad for my entree-also delicious and generous in serving. The shrimps were absolutely yummy but the salad component was alright.For the finish, and it's a good one, I enjoyed the chocolate cake with marshmallow icing to the fullest. ABC will definitely be on my comeback list."

Julia K.,"Boston, MA",3/27/2016,4 star rating,"All around phenomenal experience from the food, ambiance and staff. The starters and market tableoptions were fresh and tended to be more veggie focused. The main menu has essentially only one entree dish for each type of protein which makes the choosing a little simpler. All dishes were excellent, well seasoned and plated perfectly. Ricotta with rhubarb purée - updated version of a staple at the restaurant to reflect the spring season. Super creamy ricotta with a consistency similar to cream cheese and doused with high quality EVOORoasted beets with yogurt - mix of golden and red beets, roasted and mixed with herbs and EVOO. Delicate flavors with a nice natural sweetness Pretzel calamari - really crunch and satisfying with a marinara and chipotle mayo dipping sauce. I wish they gave a bit more in a serving...House made pasta with veal meatballs - waitress have us the heads up that the dish is sweet and savory so we wouldn't be surprised. It was mildly sweet because the sauce made of reduced Carmelites onions but it's definitely a more savory dish. The pasta has a nice bite and the number of veal meatballs was balanced. Chicken - nicely crisped chicken breast/thighs with a few fried thin potatoes skins and sliced boiled potatoes. Really moist chicken, prepared simply with salt and pepper. Hake - flaky whitefish that's pan cooked. Light flavor with half the plate covered in micro greens so makes for a refreshing dish Pork confit - approx 2 inch thick piece of pork that's pull apart texture with a nice crackling layer of skin. Accompanied with potato purée and a couple of grilled/wilted spring baby greens Side of Brussels - roasted Brussels with small cubes of pancetta. Smokey flavor without the overly saltiness that the pork can provide. Nice accompaniment to the Hake Desserts are absolutely amazing. The almond and chocolate cake were moist and nicely sized for sharing. The chocolate cake is probably slightly better than the almond cake because of the ooey gooey marshmallow topping that's been lightly torched. Soo good!!"
Josie T.,"Boston, MA",9/14/2016,5 star rating,"Five stars for the crab toast and salted caramel popcorn sundae alone! The restaurant itself is also beautiful, connecting to sister restaurant ABC Cocina and furnishing store ABC Carpet & Home. Back to the crab toast, the toast was thick and chewy while the crab meat was piled high and cooked to perfection, with the lemon aioli really bringing out the flavor. Also got the mushroom, parmesan, oregano and farm egg pizza which was delicious. For dessert, we had to get the Instagram famous salted caramel popcorn sundae, which was surprisingly not too sweet and I loved the crunch of the popcorn topping throughout. There's always a line here, so your best bet is to book a reservation at least a month in advance. I took my chances one weekday evening and only waited ~30 minutes for a table for two, which was sheer luck."
Isabella C.,"Los Angeles, CA",8/22/2018,5 star rating,"Attentive, polite waitstaff coupled with great food made for a memorable dining experience. My rose glass was never empty, as our waiter was always close by, keeping an eye on our glasses. The table was constantly being cleared by the rest of the staff, to make room for the new food being brought in. And the food itself was fantastic. We had the crab toast with lemon aoli, perfect to share between two people and very tasty, packed with a lot of crab on top as well. We also had the calamari, the roast carrot and avocado salad, and the line caught tuna sashimi. Everything we ate was flavorful, beautifully presented, and came out relatively quickly as well. The restaurant itself is very pretty, big, and spacious, but the acoustics are so well done that you can hear the person you are talking to without having to yell. I would definitely come back!"
Lois G.,"Manhattan, NY",2/25/2019,5 star rating,"Great ambiance, can be a little loud on weekends though. Good for dates and groups alike. Good cocktails, great food.The fried chicken in hot sauce-butter was great. But, the pièce de résistance... the mashed potatoes... WOW. All of the yes."
Nikki L.,"Manhattan, NY",2/27/2016,4 star rating,"3.5 StarsDecor is reminiscent of farmhouse meets simple, elegance - alot of wood elements and white used throughout.The complimentary bread with olive oil and sea salt on the side was quite good, nice and chewy.The crab toast was an enjoyable bite of crab meat mixed with aioli, tarragon, and herbs on top of crispy, hard toast. The lemon garnishes on the side helped cut down on the slightly oily feeling of the crab mix.The mushroom pizza with a runny egg on top was good but not a standout. The crust was very thin on the bottom and topped with dollops of three types of creamy white cheese (ricotta, Parmesan). I liked that the pizza had a lot of mushrooms on top...my favorite part was the mushrooms.The eggs Benedict was ordinary - a toasted English muffin with a poached egg on top, some hollandaise, and Flying Pig ham. The ham was really the best part, very tasty ham. The crisp potatoes on the side, with ketchup, were so-so.The brussel sprouts with bacon and pear was good. There was very minuscule amount of pear, the bacon didn't stand out, and the brussel sprouts were slightly bitter in the center. It was a simple dish.Most of the dishes here were simple, mostly good but not outstanding or wow-ing. I liked the crab toast the best and wouldn't reorder any of the other dishes.The dessert of salted caramel ice cream with chocolate sauce on the bottom, caramel popcorn sprinkled around and a bit of cream on top was good, not amazing but good. I liked the ice cream the best, it had good flavor, the extra garnishes weren't necessary. It was a fun, sticky, gooey mess to eat (after it melted).This place was pretty bustling for brunch around noon. There was upbeat 90's music playing throughout."
Stephanie H.,"New York, NY",1/21/2018,2 star rating,"I finally came to ABC Kitchen and I have to say I wasn't that impressed. The service was good in the beginning, until the part where the food was supposed to come, but just didn't... and the restaurant was only half filled by the time we were eating ~10pm. We sat for almost 30 minutes between the appetizer course and entree, which was just the raviolis... I didn't expect it to take over 30 minutes between collecting our appetizer plates to receiving it, to cook raviolis.... And they were a bit anti-climatic. For the price, hype, and difficulty getting a reservation, I won't be returning. I've definitely experienced better and for less money."
Xiao Ling Z.,"Queens, NY",12/17/2017,4 star rating,"So my friend made us a reservation to eat brunch here... except that she made the reservation at 11p.m.-- which was a tad later than ideal, especially when this place fills up fast and you're kind of starving.Thankfully, the staff were more than willing to accommodate and gave us seats to one of their small ""waiting"" tables that was next to the beverage area. It was not super comfortable, but I wasn't about to starve :)The food here was okay. The aesthetics here were awesome (and perhaps some of their choices were borrowed from the marketplace they're inside of).What we ordered:1. Crab toast with lemon aioli - this may have been a bit overhyped because though it was good, it was not life changing (like what I seemed to have expected).2. Goat cheese omelette - this was delicious!3. French toast - I actually didn't particularly like the french toast here, it was... too sweet for me. My friend loved it though, she said it was the best french toast she has ever had."
Eva L.,"Manhattan, NY",10/4/2017,4 star rating,"I've been wanting to try ABC Kitchen for a while, one of Jean-Gorges restaurants. It is locally sustainable and ingredients organically sourced. Tip - definitely make a reservation, and request if possible to be seated in the back area (we sat in the area between ABC Kitchen and Cocina - usually reserved for dinner parties. It was bright and beautifully decorated). My friend and I ordered the following for our dinner: Appetizers - Crab Aioli Toast: highly recommended, it was simple and delicious. It tasted like it was dipped in olive oil but the toast was still crisp, a nice amount of crab meat on top. This might have been my favorite dish although portion is quite small if you are sharing (it was so good, we definitely wanted more!)Ravioli Ricotta - delicious and simple, it was flavorful and the ricotta was a nice touch. Classic dish and very well madeEntree - Ordered both fish for our main. Sea Bass and The fish was okay, well cooked and very healthy and light. It was more in a brothy light sauce versus heavy potatoes. The waiter did point this out to us and suggested we order sides. Portions were a bit small for the price.Dessert - Chocolate cake. Nothing extraordinary but it's chocolate cake! Overall, the ambiance was beautiful. I would consider going here for my birthday - great for groups as they have long tables. ABC vibe decor throughout (the furniture store is next to the restaurant so you can also shop there after your meal!), white wooden chairs and tables, pretty chandeliers, decorations that exude a classy, elegant, yet casual vibe like you could be in somebody's apartment for a dinner party. Loved the decor."
Jocelyn B.,"New York, NY",3/28/2018,3 star rating,I wish I could give this 3 and a half stars. Our waitress was a lovely person but service was relatively slow. There was a lot of time between each dish. The absolute must get is the fried chicken and mashed potatoes. The other things we had were good but nothing unreal. The asparagus pizza was advertised as having prosciutto but it was actually pancetta pieces. The ricotta just had too much rhubarb.
Jando S.,"Houston, TX",7/26/2013,5 star rating,"There was a time when ABC Kitchen was undisputedly my favorite restaurant in Manhattan. Not ""best"" mind you, just simply my favorite after so many wonderful experiences for all occasions. It was a restaurant that rarely got anything wrong and produced a countless array of quality dishes that were delicious, potent with all sorts of tongue tingling flavors, and remarkable in their consistency and execution. After bursting onto the scene two years ago and winning a bevy of ""new restaurant"" awards, including one from the James Beard Foundation, co-owner Jean-George Vongerichten made the mantra of the restaurant quite simple: local, organic, with nods  to sustainability, presentation, and quality. Countless patrons, reviews, and reservations later, it still remains as one of the city's most popular mid-to-high end dining destinations.The trendy, yet contemporary decor is a nice departure from the other line of JG restaurants. There isn't a night where it isn't bustling with people and reservations are almost always recommended. Sit at the bar for a tasty cocktail or two and if there is time to kill, chance an experience with a walk-in anyway. The food is definitely worth the wait.To suggest that one can't go wrong with ordering anything on the menu may seem a bit ambitious, but my advice is to always heed the seasonal recommendations from the server and then choose a few dishes to share. Go for simple and eat something you know you're likely to enjoy. One can be like regular patrons and constantly shoot for something different. After all, not being afraid to experiment means there are plenty of surprises to be had.Their salads, appetizers, and seafood choices have been the strongest contenders on a plate for me. Salads like a beet or kale salad, which are both wickedly simple but are incredibly tasty and would count for meals on their own. Whether its the chicken liver pate toast or the lump crab meat aioli, or even the kombucha squash toast, all are stellar choices. From the sea bass, salmon, cod to the burger, fried chicken, and homemade sausages, it is all truly tasty and salivating from start to end. If there was anything to avoid, it would be the suckling pig, which at $34 feels like a lot to pay for a small brick of crispy pork.ABCK's price point of $$$ is pretty accurate and quite reasonable considering the variety they offer. Service is always outstanding and the wait staff is usually efficient and knowledgeable about the menu. The knock of course would be their wait times, which for many quality establishments is practically a prerequisite of something wonderful in the making."
Foodiewithamap ..,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1/12/2019,3 star rating,"Nice girls night/date night spot! I came here with a group of girls and we loved the romantic interiors and food. Dishes aren't really shareable, but they are delicious. Definitely try the pizzas, the crust was perfectly crisp and toppings fresh"
Paige J.,"Sacramento, CA",10/17/2015,5 star rating,"Food here is phenomenal. Have to get a reservations if you want to eat within the hour, but we simply say and ate at the bar. Friend worked for the furniture boutique inside, crazy to think that every chair in there is over $1000, and they are so simple. Take in the decor, it's really like a boutique furniture store that you eat amazing high quality food at!Roasted beets were incredibly tender and delicious, yogurt was a great pairing. Crab toast was a little toasted but flavor a were delicious. Tuna sashimi was perfect. Sauce was perfect. Some of the best quality tuna I've had in a while. Ricotta ravioli was equally impressive and delectable. I'm really not sure you can go wrong here."
Haley M.,"Hudson, NH",3/10/2020,5 star rating,"incredible, amazing, delicious, did I say incredible?! All 5 of the people in my party enjoyed our meals and drinks. I had the cauliflower soup and ricotta ravioli. We started with the calamari and others at the table had their tuna starter and a mushroom pizzette. Nothing on the menu was bad and the environment is so cozy and inviting. Id highly recommend checking this restaurant out!"
Tova B.,"Jersey City, NJ",11/27/2017,5 star rating,"One of my BFFs was dying to eat here. What better occasion than her birthday! We booked our reservation and were ready to go!My BFF and I arrived first. We were super early, so we got drinks at the bar while we waited for the rest of our party. I got a regular margarita on the rocks, and it was delicious. As soon as our party showed up, we were seated. Our server was super nice and attentive... and patient, especially for our large, loud group. I'm pretty sure we ordered every starter on the menu. We also ordered ricotta and fig. My husband loved it so much, he ordered one for himself. Who is this? My husband doesn't eat figs! We order a fig the prosciutto pizza and also got the mushroom and farm egg pizza. So good! I think the only entree our table didn't order, was the burger. Everything was delicious. The worst part? I got too full, too quick. I ended up taking my entree home. Dessert (it was a birthday after all) we did the sundae's and because it was a birthday, they also gave us cookies. If you were thinking about going here, just reserve your table and do it. You will not be disappointed. I can't wait to go back!"
Rosa J.,"New York, NY",3/9/2019,5 star rating,"Wonderful service and flavorful food! Overall the decor was a beautiful rustic farm look but a bit loud as the tables were set close together. You will also get bread only if you ask for it which is a concept I don't get because while you're waiting for food, you're left with a confused feeling of, ""Oh how come that table got bread? Is that something that comes with something they ordered?"" Our waiter apologetically said they are told not to suggest or even offer bread unless we ask for it. Strange. Our appetizers and entrees were great though and chocolate cake delicious."
Jasmine W.,"New York, NY",11/2/2015,1 star rating,"Greeted with friendly host. However,  the bartender put no smile on her. Do not like her vibes.  Drinks were too blend. Food was below my expectation.  Veal meatball with ribbon pasta was too salty. However, I do like the after taste of the sauce. You can never go wrong with fried calamari. I do like the 2 different kind of dipping sauce. Crab toast was just chunk of minced crabs that tossed on top of the over toasted bread but I do like the aoli. Although the service and food were below my expectation, we still tipped her 20% after taxed  but we will not return. Dissapointed with Jean Georges establishment again and qgain. Will try my very best to avoid spice, mercer kitchen and abc kitchen.I was a big fan of JG, sigh.P/s: truly annoyed by server telling me that ""everything is so good here"". Really? Shall I order everything from the menu then?"
Emitom H.,"Dallas, TX",6/8/2018,5 star rating,"ABC Kitchen has been on my NYC restaurant list for over a year so I was so excited when I was able to get a reservation during my most recent visit. I celebrated my birthday with a large group of friends at one of the round tables. They are great for a large group as you can talk to the whole table instead of being only able to talk to the people around you.We started with a round of their cocktails. We ordered around 4 different varieties and everyone was extremely satisfied. They were refreshing and tasty, but not too sugary. We also received fresh bread, which we quickly devoured.For appetizers, we ordered the cured meats and local cheeses, roasted beats with housemade yogurt, housemade ricotta, and pretzel dusted calamari. While all of them were delicious, my favorite was the calamari. The pretzel dust added a hint of salt to the calamari, which made it unique. It's a dish I would return to ABC Kitchen just to get.For mains, we ordered a variety of of dishes including the fettucini, casarecce, and the fried chicken. The fettucini came with a basil-pistachio pesto that is one of the best pestos I've ever eaten. Although all the food was delicious, the fried chicken was the standout. I was nervous when the waiter recommended it to a group of Texans, but we were not disappointed. On the outside it was lighter and more crisp than your typical fried chicken and on the inside it was super juicy and flavorful. I don't think I will ever be able to return to ABC Kitchen without ordering that chicken.Overall, ABC Kitchen went above and beyond my expectations. It was such an enjoyable birthday dinner as they let us take our time throughout the night and we could talk to everyone at the round table. They kindly stored a birthday cake and brought it out with candles. Also, their delicious, but healthy options didn't make me feel as guilty for eating out. I can't wait to get back to New York and eat here again!"
Mimzy F.,"New York, NY",9/5/2017,2 star rating,"What happened here! Meant to make a reservation for ABC Cocina, but made it for here instead. Figured, why not try. WELL left on a pretty bad note and don't think it's worth trying again. The pros: decor was fantastic (so many details even down to the bread plates), prices were what we expected although still high and the ambiance is vary cool. Loud but still calm! The food options were great. Two of the dishes were pretty spicy but didn't have that denoted on the menu (even with just the word spicy), so that was kind of annoying because the same one person ordered them both and was struggling a bit towards the end of her meal as spice isn't her thing. I got the meat and cheese board which wasn't great - three REALLY strong cheeses that didn't go well together, but the meats were great. Also would have loved some thinner bread so that I didn't end up eating an entire loaf just to spread my cheese on something. The service throughout the entire meal wasn't great - we waited a really long time for our food and had to keep flagging random people over because we weren't really even sure who our waitress was since a few different people served us. Our food took over 30 minutes to come out, so we did follow up and ask about that, which I normally don't like to do. It was by no means crowded enough to have things take that long. Our actual ""waitress"" (don't know if we had multiple or she was the main one or what), we super nice and friendly, just wasn't around much. Anyway, we're all finishing up and I asked for some of my meat and cheese board to go as that's easy to eat later and I did have a decent amount of meat left. The cheeses were a little messy after having been cut to spread, so I wasn't expecting to bring home much of that anyway. We order dessert and my to go bag doesn't come out, so I ask and they let me know that they accidentally threw it away and that they're going to just prepare me a new one to take home. I let them know they didn't need to, but that I truly appreciated it as there was a decent amount left. Dessert comes, gets eaten, cleared. Check comes, gets paid, dad goes to get the car, PARKS it again, comes back in and we're still sitting there waiting for the meat and cheese to come back out. Nothing on this dish is cooked, so you would think there would be no delay in bringing another one out. We ask for a third time where it is and the original waitress finally comes out, very apologetic, and says here you go, double cheese and we leave. I thought double cheese just meant I was getting to eat the dish twice, but no, turns out they just put two pieces of each cheese (and already what had been my least favorite part) and NO meat, which is really what they had thrown out the most of. Also, what took an hour to cut 6 pieces of cheese?Really would have originally left it with a 3-4 star rating, but leaving almost an hour later than I needed to for THAT was ridiculous."
Elaine H.,"New York, NY",8/2/2015,5 star rating,"Always thought of brunch as simple as ham and egg, I was completely impressed by the way ABC Kitchen brought up its own courses, which was renown for the idea of farm-to-table. Wasn't underwhelmed by the simplicity in food presentation,  I would strongly recommend the crab toast, which was listed under the list of 50 most famous food to eat in NYC before dying. It was coming in small portion, so you probably want to order some main dishes besides that. My choice was crispy oyster with scrambled egg and spicy butter sauce. Our waitress was extremely attentive, smiling at us all the time asking whether we need anything else. This place now becomes my favorite brunch place in the city!"
Eric B.,"Lesquin, France",5/16/2017,4 star rating,"Fancy restaurant. Too many waiters coming to your table (one for the bread, one for the water,..) make the place a bit too pretentious. But you forget about this once you start eatingThe food is exceptional. I tried the divine crab toast and the delicious mushroom pizza.Definitely a place to go when you're in NYC"
Kendal K.,"Westlake Village, CA",1/1/2018,5 star rating,"I just left dinner at this incredible restaurant, and I am already planning when I can eat there again! It was delicious. The food was all cooked perfectly, and the dishes portrayed the natural beauty and flavors of each fresh ingredient. Our waitress was kind, funny, and friendly, and I enjoyed hearing her insights about the key and the restaurant. I loved the decor and atmosphere of the restaurant--It was artsy, interesting, and unique. I loved my sashimi and carrot-avocado salad appetizers, Hake fish entree, and dairy-free chocolate mint sorbet!"
Nikki H.,"Brooklyn, NY",1/15/2016,4 star rating,"My dinner date had a connection who got us a reservation for tonight. The space is beautifully decorated and the service was superb. We shared the carrot salad and the crab tartine with lemon aioli. Both were delish. The carrots had a bit of heat (spice) to them but not too much.I had ravioli stuffed with ricotta as my entree and a glass of Merlot. Nice, light and flavorful.We shared the seasonal donuts and those were great as well.This is a nice restaurant but a bit pricey. I'll definitely be back but not often."
Kristie L.,"Queens, NY",1/16/2016,4 star rating,"ABC Kitchen provides a full dining experience. From the food to the ambience and finally the service. The service is fantastic here. The waiters are so attentive that when my friend went to the bathroom, a waiter came and picked up the napkin he left on his seat and refolded it. He refolded a USED napkin. Maybe I don't eat at enough places with this type of service, but I was blown away. I even saw a hostess helping customers into their seats. Food: Overall, the food is good. The portions are actually enough to fill you up. Although it's very pricy, I can see how the chefs take the time to make sure everything is properly made.Seasonal Glazed Donuts ($10): They give 2 donuts. I was pleasantly surprised by both flavors. It turns out that the chocolate one was a Dark Chocolate Glazed! I was really happy that they used dark chocolate, but it was overshadowed by the second donut. The plain glazed one turned out to be a Lemon Glazed & after my first bite, I knew that was it. If I ever order this dish again, I would ask for 2 Lemon Glazed Donuts.The donuts weren't overly oily or fried. They were soft, but not the softest that I've had. Thankfully, both flavors weren't overly sweet. Burger ($24):My friend asked for the burger to be cooked medium and it was perfectly cooked. The cheese is grated, which is unusual technique for a burger. However, it's not the best burger that my friend has had.Scrambled Eggs with Crispy Oyster ($23):Crispy is just a fancy word for fried...there were about 5-6 oysters in the dish. It's not overly oily, but you can taste how unhealthy it is. My favorite part of the dish was the eggs. The scrambled eggs are soooo silky (I think they added some cheese) and soft, I LOVED it. Although the portion looks small, it was the perfect amount. I asked for the butter to be placed on the side, which I'm glad I did because it was totally unnecessary.This restaurant does have a long waiting time. Reservations fill up quickly, so book ASAP (like a week or more in advance). Otherwise, walk-ins are accepted. They do text you when your table is ready. At 12pm on a Saturday, I had to wait about 40-45 mins for a table of 2. I definitely recommend making a reservation because the tables they seat you at are nicer and have better lighting. We were seated at a communal table, but we didn't have to share it with anyone."
Janesse S.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",10/15/2019,5 star rating,"Really delicious and amazing place to have brunch! During my bachelorette party weekend, we had brunch here. The menu had the bachelorette party slogan and the service was amazing! The items that were brought out (tuna tartare, calamari, French roast, eggs, I can go on and on) were absolutely amaazingggg! Not to mention the service was truly amazing."
Cindy O.,"New York, NY",11/20/2017,2 star rating,"Liked the ambience, decor, and interior. However, the server kept interrupting our conversation and giving us a pressure to leave the table asap. I calculated how long we stayed there. From the moment we went in and the time we came out, it took only one and a half hour. I understand it's a popular place but it was definitely not a pleasant experience.Besides, there was a hair from the food that we ordered. As soon as we told them about it, the server said they'll bring a new food. Okay but another big reason that we couldn't love this place, the ""hygiene.""Food-wise it was okay.. Just okay. Maybe I expected too high or so?"
Grace S.,"Brooklyn, NY",1/22/2016,5 star rating,"I came here for the restaurant week deal and was very excited to try this Jean-Georges establishment. I had to really bite down and check for a dropped reservation every hour, on the hour this week and I finally snagged one for a Friday lunch. The entrance to this restaurant is deceivingly small and subtle considering how massive it is inside. It was very busy during this lunch hour, but because it was so spacious it didn't feel too crowded. The interior is very hip with young vibes and minimalistic in design which matches the organic, fresh theme of the restaurant. They first start you off with some delicious bread and olive oil which is always a plus for me. My boyfriend and I started with the TUNA SASHIMI and KALE SALAD. The Tuna Sashimi was tasty and buttery soft dressed with a light garlic dressing! The Kale salad was very fresh and fluffy (never thought i'd describe a salad like that), but a bit underwhelming. *tip* after I was done with the sashimi, there was leftover garlic dressing left and I dipped some bread in it and it was amazing! Just a little suggestion for anyone who orders the tuna!We then had the EGG RAVIOLI stuffed with a creamy ricotta cheese and a runny egg yolk (If you don't like runny yolk, you should let them know!) over a delicious pork ragu. This is probably one of the best dishes I have ever had in my life. The pork was braised perfectly and so soft and savory against the creamy ricotta cheese and egg. An unexpected combination that really delivered with all of its complementary textures. Also, I would like to note that I was stuffeddd after this dish. For dessert, we had the ALMOND CAKE with sorbet and the SALTED CARAMEL ICE CREAM with cream fraiche and popcorn. The almond cake was light with a very subtle almond taste which I appreciated. It was a bit dry so the cream that came with it really helped, but the SORBET. Ohmygod, hands down the best sorbet I have ever had. So light and tangy and refreshing, I would have just ordered bowls and bowls of that. The Salted Caramel Ice Cream was on the richer side with chocolate syrup underneath, but still delicious. The toffee popcorn was softer than I expected which is a big plus for me because I have sensitive teeth (I sound like an old lady). But,i probably wouldn't come back for that one, but definitely coming back for that sorbet though. All in all, great experience and service. Waiters were knowledgeable about the menu and were happy to give recommendations. Also, as a restaurant week deal, my boyfriend and I had the 3 course meal for only $25 each which is a steal!!! The ambiance was fantastic and I would love to come back again and try more things on the menu. This spot exceeded my expectations and definitely lives up to the hype."

Josephine L.,"Manhattan, NY",9/29/2015,3 star rating,"Reasons to come to ABC Kitchen:- Stunning decor: I mean, really. How can any place be so beautiful, so breathtaking, so deliciously, utterly DISTRESSED? (That's an interior decorating style, in case you're scratching your head.)- Fantastic mixology: Fresh ingredients, unique combinations, this is what NY mixology is all about. The Basil Lime Daiquiri with papagayo rum and fresh lime juice is a perfect example- Farm-to-table cuisine: The roasted portobello mushroom with celery leaves is like being served hors d'oeuvres by Mother Nature herself. The roasted cod with cauliflower, crushed herbs and lime is picture-perfect freshnessReasons not to come to ABC Kitchen:- The Happy Hour crowd: Prepare to be ogled by men (and some women). Prepare to be shouted down by your neighbors loudly discussing synergy and other corporate terms that have no relevance to you. Ear plugs and a proficiency in sign language are highly recommended if you are dining during these hours- The lackluster service: Perhaps fueled by the HH crowd, service is intermittent and not always the friendliest- Some menu duds: This isn't a place with a home run menu. Some offerings--both food and drink-wise--are not very good. Skip the cider cocktail, for example."
Toniya D.,"Bronx, NY",8/7/2015,5 star rating,"Seriously the best semi- fancy Resturant experience I have ever had, my best friend and I came around 7pm they said the wait would be any 1hour so we left because she didn't want to wait and instead she got Chipotle, so we got seated and I waited for her to finish her food. When we got back to the Resturant it was 8:00 the lady said the wait would be  45 minutes my friend didn't want to wait but she knew I really wanted to eat here so we waited. You have to stand no seating or waiting area. Anyways we got seated early at the bar 8:20 to be exact I guess if we wanted a table we would have had to wait longer. We got seated at  the bar my friend didn't want anything since she had just finish eating chipotle but I told her she could try some of my food. The bartender gave us water which came in very small glasses and had small cardboard cut outs underneath as coasters the water was cold and she gave us the menu to look at. Then she gave us a sheet of I think paper and then a cloth, and silver wear. I ordered strawberry soda she made it right in front of me, came out of a squeeze bottle that looked like bbq sauce must have been the syrup to make it, tasted like fresh strawberries with a soda fizz. Then I asked the bartender if I could order my food. I ordered the crab toast which everyone raves about and the organic fried chicken with basil spinach underneath it  and hot sauce butter around it. The crab toast was AMAZING  before we even got it you could smell the crab it was cut into about 4 pieces it was oily or buttery I'm  not exactly sure but our hands were left greasy. A couple of minutes later I was waiting for my chicken it was taking a little longer to come, when it came I cut it in half to let my friend try she didn't like it but that's because she doesn't like fried things so I took it back I was not going to let her waste my chicken because once I got a bite of it, it was everything and more than I had hoped for I was starving and everything about that chicken tasted like heaven maybe because I haven't had fried chicken in a while IDK but it was everything the spicy butter sauce  complimented the bland spinach and kind of kept the heat down but I had water for that anyways. My bill in total came up to 59.88 the cheapest of the expensive restaurants I have had to pay for, the crab toast was $16, the chicken was 32 and then my soda was $7.00 I could be wrong I didn't see the cents behind the rest of the receipt I didn't look at it for too long. MAKE SURE YOU MAKE A RESERVATION it makes things way simpler we are definitely coming back for lunch can't wait and dinner again to try other things. I SERIOUSLY CANT WAIT."
Steph C.,"Brooklyn, NY",9/3/2015,5 star rating,"Definitely a place for a special occasion. Not because it's fancy (although it sort of is), but because it's just that good. Also you pretty much need to book a reservation at least a month out if you want to dine at a decent timeABC Kitchen, like the ABC furniture store, is beautiful and aesthetically pleasing. Sort of rustic modern homey decor. We sat in the area where the bar is, outside the main dining room. I actually preferred it because it was less dark and quieter. Except for the large table where a family was apparently taking their kids out for a ""casual"" dinner (Can I be in that family?).We ordered the following:1) Crab Toast - This is apparently a must-order item. After tasting the fresh chunks of crab with lemon aioli on toasted thick cut bread, I definitely agree.2) Shaved Raw Fluke - Nice presentation, and the fluke was very fresh. The olives, chilies, and dill gave it a salty sour combination that was odd, but grew on me the more I ate it.3) Roasted Halibut - While I like halibut and this was one of the better halibut dishes, it paled in comparison to the pork. It did make for a nice light summer dish with the vegetables and basil. Still, next time I'd probably choose another entree on the menu.4) Crispy Pork Confit - Was there any doubt that this dish wouldn't be excellent? It came with smoked bacon cherry marmalade and braised turnips. The pork was so incredibly delicious. Service was great as well, and overall an incredible dining experience."
Bonnie N.,"Klamath Falls, OR",3/24/2016,5 star rating,"Absolutely fantastic. Our lunch here was memorable and oh, so delicious. Wonderful atmosphere, attention to detail is obviously very important to them, delicious, QUALITY food, and attentive, friendly service. What a beautiful place!Craft sodas were outstanding. Salted caramel sundae was absolute heaven. Crab toast was dreamy. Prix fixe lunch was a good value. Even the olive oil for dipping was top shelf. Even though we left stuffed, we felt fantastic, the true test of good quality ingredients. What a wonderful experience."
Diane W.,"Manhattan, NY",1/1/2016,5 star rating,"Came here for a New Year's Day slash early birthday lunch with the family. Had a great experience - and now it's become one of my favorite restaurants in the city.First off, the atmosphere of the place was so cute and rustic. There were delicate China plates with rose bouquets in mini glass vases on every table. There were also lovely tree vines and white chandeliers throughout the dining room. Decor was definitely on point!For appetizers, we ordered he crab aioli toast and the tuna sashimi. Both were delicious and very flavorful. The ginger sauce on the tuna sashimi was especially memorable. For my entree I ordered the mushroom and egg pizza. SO good. Only gripe is that the pizza became easily soggy since the crust was so thin. Flavor wise the pizza was excellent and I loved how there was an egg cracked over the top! My sister ordered a brunch item - the scrambled eggs with fried oysters. Really yummy as well, the oysters were incredibly soft and tender. Portion size was small however. My mom ordered the veggie burger, which was more like a falafel sandwich. Super flavorful as well. Dad ordered the hake, a new item on the menu. The sauce was delicious and surprisingly spicy. The fish was really nice and flaky.For dessert, I got the chocolate cake, which they so kindly decorated for my birthday. Super chocolatey with a lovely marshmallow-meringue frosting. My sister got the pumpkin creme brûlée which was excellent - the pomegranate sorbet on top tasted EXACTLY like pomegranate. It was a little on the sweeter side though. My dad, who isn't much of a dessert person, really enjoyed his trio of sorbets.Service was really really good. Our waiters were very attentive and provided us with a lot of information when we were indecisive about dishes. Highly recommend, and would come back in the future!"
Mathew S.,"Warwick, RI",1/11/2020,5 star rating,Amazing food! Best veggie burger I've ever had! Great service! Highly recommended. Tuna sashimi and house rose were also fantastic
Lyn M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",2/9/2019,5 star rating,"Beautiful interior, delicious food, ultra friendly staff. We ordered nearly everything on the menu and everything was great! I loved all of it, from appetizers like the crab  toast and kabocha toast(both amazing), mains(we had the salmon and skate), to their desserts--. Jean George never disappoints! A more rustic feel in comparison to his other restaurants but flavors are just as intricate and ingredients fresh. Definitely going back soon!"
Joanne L.,"Manhattan, NY",4/16/2016,4 star rating,"Finally got a reservation to come to ABC kitchen for lunch! We still had to wait about 15 minutes before we were seated. Chic interior and open space feel. Food was good, servers were attentive, and experience overall was great. Trendy spot that's definitely worth trying at least once."
Scott P.,"Miami, FL",3/13/2017,5 star rating,"A must visit! We arrived when they opened at 11am and it was packed by 1130am. Everyone who works there was smiling and so friendly! We had the crab toast, mushroom and farm egg pizza and chocolate cake for dessert. Only complaint is pizza has ricotta cheese on it but the menu does not say that. The vodka thyme lemonade was great! I also had the mermaid pilsner which was nice too."
Y A.,"Manhattan, NY",6/22/2016,5 star rating,"Food - amazingDrinks - DeliciousService - ExcellentThe vibe - Elegant but comfortableYes, it's not somewhere that's easy to get reservations but it's worth planning ahead. The dishes that you share are the best over the entrees. I've been here many times and I still crave their food. With so many restaurants in the city, I rarely go to the same one so many times but this one is a winner!"
Jay S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1/25/2020,1 star rating,"Waited an hour and half for undercooked raw burgers, undercooked pancakes, an average pizza, and French toast.  Each item came out sporadically the course of 90 mins.  The waiter was un-resourceful and told us the chef cannot remake the pancakes."
Stefany W.,"Los Angeles, CA",3/15/2016,4 star rating,"Okay, I can see the hype here.  The food was delicious and the service was impeccable.I came here last night with two other girls.  We ordered the crab toast and the roasted cauliflower.  They were both fantastic!  The crab was fresh and lightly seasoned with some lemon and the cauliflower was light with that delicious egg yolk on it.I ordered the mushroom pizza as my entree and it was so good! The yolk oozed over the crust and the mushroom was decadent.  My friends ordered the pork confit and the roasted hake.  They both said they were delicious.For dessert, we ordered the salted caramel popcorn sundae and the rhubarb pie (for pi day!).  They were both really really good.  The pie was surprisingly delicious and had the consistency of an apple pie with a bit of tartness.  The sundae was also great especially with the crunchy popcorn and the chocolate.  So divine!I would definitely stop by again."
Juju J.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",12/20/2019,3 star rating,"First I will say the servers are great. My issue was with the food. Ordered the cauliflower soup which was brought cold. Sent it back to get warmed. Ordered the salmon red cabbage and apple mustard. Couldn't get through the sweet flavor of the red cabbage and the overwhelming mustard sauce. The salmon was dry and it was not fun to eat just because it wasn't hot enough. I called restaurant to give feedback to manager, they took my number and email but never received any communication back. The food left a lot to be desired and just not the best dining experience for lunch."
Nhi D.,"Brooklyn, NY",1/28/2018,5 star rating,"The chicken liver and crab breads are worth the hype!! They're sooooo delicious and light for appetizers! I had pesto penne, which was also great . I'd come back again to try out other meals on the seasonal menus."
Alicia C.,"Manhattan, NY",3/7/2016,5 star rating,"I ate here last summer, didn't review it but knew I needed to when I still remember how damn good the fried chicken with hot sauce butter was. OMG. Beyond yummy. That was the final course following another 6-7 other plates of unparalleled flavor bombs. Our group did a family style chef's tasting menu. Best dining decision of summer 2015.Highly recommend coming here. It's beautifully appointed and the ambiance wraps you in comfort and rustic luxury. The back area is great for a large group dinner if you so desire. Will definitely be back!"
Elizabeth L.,"New York, NY",1/3/2021,5 star rating,"Came here for dinner last night and had a great experience. I'd been to all three ABC restaurants before, but not since before COVID and I really enjoyed the combined menu they have at the moment.  Though I missed some of the menu items from the individual restaurants, it was fun to be able to order from all 3 and everything was delicious.  We particularly enjoyed the truffle, egg, and fontina pizza, the green hummus, and the crab toast. Arroz con pollo and the cauliflower were also very good. For dessert we loved the salted caramel sundae. Great service and warm outdoor seating as well."
Victoria J.,"New York, NY",12/15/2018,4 star rating,"The space is beautiful, and all the food we had was very well executed. My single gripe is that for a place with such hype, I just expected a more creative menu."
Anna K.,"Manhattan, NY",3/3/2016,5 star rating,"My mother always wanted to eat here and as an aspiring pastry chef and avid food venturer, I gladly took me and my mother here for lunch. We didn't make reservations and was told a table would be ready for us in ten minutes, but if we didn't mind the bar, we could sit and dine immediately. We chose to sit at the back bar which connects Abc kitchen to the abc store and the other abc tapas restaurant. The environment was absolutely exquisite and elegant. It had a modern, yet rustic and homey feel due to the white wall contrast to the wood piers and furniture. Everything from the plates to the tables looked organic. At the bar We had a lovely server- she was so sweet and took care of us.We ordered the mushroom toast, the beets with housemate yogurt, and the roasted carrot salad.My mother and I shared everything. We had cute European tea like plates which had a spring like feel to them. The other plates were thin and rustic looking made of clay in this cream Ivory color which complimented every dish. The mushroom toast came out first - it was presided into four pieces but presented as one whole toast- there were thin slices of pecorino cheese under a sautéed mushroom with a light gravy which was then added to some sort of lemon juice that didn't overpower the entire mushroom topping to make it super tangy or sour. It was absolute perfection - I'm craving it as I am writing about it- the bread was incredible- artisan and full of flavor, crunch with a dark crust. The beet salad came next- and goodness it was a sight to see!! The colors were vibrant and beautiful and the Reds, yellows and white and the small micro greens made the presentation look inedible. But we are it anyways. The housemate yogurt was so creamy and not too tarte. It complimented the balsamic glaze which sat at the bottom of the bowl topped with moist and perfectly boiled(?) beets of red and yellow. It tasted clean and fresh, a much different experience in your mouth and palate compared to the mushroom toast. Finally the roasted carrot salad came out- our sweet server told the kitchen we were sharing and kindly split the salad on to two separate plates for us! The carrots sat at the bottom while the toasted sesame and sunflower seeds decored the top of the salad. I believe what it was as broccoli or some sort of sprouts were the main green with a light (very light and perfectly) dressed with some sort of dressing. It was a very refreshing dish except I found myself disappointed because the carrots were surprising seasoned with curry- lots of it; so much that it overpowered the flavor of the carrots which I was hoping to taste. Overall, my mother and I were truly overjoyed with our experience there and will definitely plan to go back soon!"
Millie S.,"Manhattan, NY",5/11/2017,4 star rating,"Great food and wine, great service. I moved to NYC from a little town in Texas so it took me a while to wrap my head around how there was a well-known restaurant inside a carpet and furniture store, of all places. But ABC Kitchen is so established for a reason. My friends and I tried several dishes for dinner - Crab toast with lemon aioli: I would literally come back just to eat this toast. The crab is so fresh and tender, and worked so well with the toast and aioli that my heart did palpitations. I think everyone should try this at least once.Shaved raw fluke with horseradish, celery root, and lemon: Very refreshing in its lightness, but also very, very, horseradishy. I didn't get much of the other flavors as everything was drowned out by one note.Pasta with pork ragu and chile oil: I think this was taken off the menu so I can't find the exact name now, but in any case, it was delicious. Very interesting combination of traditional Italian fare with Chinese chile oil. I hope this comes back sometime!Fried organic chicken with collard greens and hot sauce butter: This'll make you regret every bad decision you've ever made regarding your waistline, but it's guilty pleasure food at its best so get it anyway. To be perfectly honest, I'm not sure how well a pool of spicy butter works with crispy fried chicken; some people will be like 'gross' and some will be like 'give it here right now' and for better or worse my gluttonous stomach falls into the latter camp.Crispy pork confit with braised turnips and smoked bacon marmalade: Literally fall off the bone good - easily a crowd favorite.Salted caramel ice cream: Terrific. We agreed that we should've gone with the sundae though - it sounds like a lot, but several scoops of just salted caramel ice cream by itself, no matter how good, gets a little monotonous pretty quickly.The main gripe I have with ABC is that somehow, it feels too impersonal. Food was wonderful and service professional, but something about the ambience had me feeling almost like I was part of a museum exhibit on dining."
Rusty R.,"Jersey City, NJ",4/1/2018,3 star rating,"Gorgeous interior look and A+ service.  But the food was just ok, and for the price paid, that's not good enough.Came here for Easter brunch.  Starters:Homemade Ricotta with Rhubarb Compote was great- best thing I had there.Roasted Carrot and Avocado salad was good.  Had a spicy kick.Entrees:French toast was just ok.  It was overly-and unnecessarily-sweet.  Would not order again.Casarecce pasta dish was good.  I only had a bite (someone else ordered it) but I wished I had gotten that instead.Desserts:Rhubarb Pie with White Chocolate Ice Cream.  Good.   I love rhubarb.  It was presented as a personal-sized pie, which was beautiful.  But, as I said to my friend, ""mom's is better."" Take that for what it's worth.Chocolate Creme Brulee.  Good. Very bitter.  For a real chocolate lover.I'd have to say it was about 25% overpriced, even taking into account the atmosphere and service.  So....meh."
Sabrina L.,"New York, NY",10/20/2019,4 star rating,"Solid food options and a gorgeous place overall -- great date spot. I had the butternut squash pasta and it was so good and unique. I also had the burger, which was good but nothing out of this world. The Apple dessert with the hazelnut ice cream though... phenomenal. I wanted a tub of that ice cream to go home. I also had the margarita, respectable."
Sarah C.,"Toronto, Canada",4/19/2018,2 star rating,"This restaurant is a perfect example of an overhyped yelp  lunch bag letdown. Very noisy, terrible service, undercooked and mediocre food that is priced at a level far exceeding the quality provided. Have been super excited to come here for some time and was very disappointed.I am not the kind of person who gets upset with bad service because if the food is on point then happy tummy triumphs over annoyances like: unnoticed empty glasses, wrong drink orders set down on the table, waiting for someone to notice dirty finished plates for 20 min while we politely wait for someone to notice and/or please bring the bill so we can leave and go save the night by getting shake shack up the street. Had the crab toast was just ok. Not much flavor. Tuna sashimi was ok but lacking imagination; pretty much like you would expect it to be with some diced mint and soy sauce. Pesto pasta was a pile of undercooked stodgy starch. Oily and no flavor; barely touched and server didn't notice although when told it was was undercooked, offered to replace but did not remove from the bill. Ravioli was good. Well cooked and good flavor.Overall would not return. So many other better places to go in this city both with lower and higher priced options."
Connie H.,"Brooklyn, NY",9/17/2017,3 star rating,"This has been on my list for a really long time. The decor of this restaurant makes it the perfect place to take a girl out and impress her. Cute shabby chic vibe with fresh flowers at the table with mismatching vintage plates.The good-The food was good and not overpriced except for a few dishes. The mushroom, Parmesan, and farm egg pizza was our favorite as it was interesting. At $22, it's probably the best bang for me your buck. We also loved the pork confit. It was almost like Chinese BBQ pork, but elevated. The pork was extremely tender as in melts completely when you jab your fork into it, but they managed to give you a crispy skin on top of it. It's also topped with bacon. We didn't order the fried chicken, but our neighbor did. We were slightly jealous. It looked really good.The okay -Crab toast with lemon aioli was our app. It was recommended by our waitress and the crab meat was fresh, but nothing too special. I did like it more than the crab cakes at Jean Georges. The cocktails at $16 were all just okay. Nothing too extraordinary and we tried almost all of them on the menu. I had to send a spicy watermelon Mezcal back because it was a little too blend.  We thought the strawberry royale was too sweet. Service was alright. Our server was nice. Not super attentive, but we got what we needed.The bad-Crispy mushrooms as a side. They were 3 tiny little mushrooms lightly fried with a lighter aioli type of sauce. The mushrooms weren't flavorful at all and the sauce wasn't extraordinary to compensate for how boring the mushrooms were. They just looked good. They could have given me mini portobellos and they would of have more flavor. Did I mention those 3 tiny mushrooms cost us $13!?!? If you charge that much, they better be special. Also, the bathroom at abc kitchen is disgusting! The walls are dirty. The toilets have pee all over it. The mirrors are purposely blemished for the antique look, but ummm can I at least get a spot where I can see my face?The soap dispensers are broken with soap everywhere."

Holly W.,"Libertyville, IL",6/21/2018,5 star rating,"First time here, made​ a reservation for our anniversary​. Steps of service from beginning to end was outstanding. My man asked the bartender if she could create something fun with a mezcal base (they have plenty of options on the cocktail list but he didn't like some of the ingredients) and​ she sent out this chocolate bitters inspired ""martini"" and he really enjoyed it. The sweet bartender even came by our table to check on us to be sure he liked it- and the bar was busy - so that was super kind of her to find a moment to do that. I LOVED the Palmoa on the list- with a full sprig of mint! Christian, the Reservation Specialist, personally​ stopped by our table to welcome us. He recommended​ some of his favorites and made us feel ""VIP."" The restaurant​ was busy but it did not affect the timing or synchronicity of our experience. Heather, our server, was detail oriented and found the perfect balance of checking in without hovering and overseeing our courses were delivered​ without a long waiting​ period. There was also hip young man with a beard assisting​ her, making sure our table was properly cleared and re-set. I never felt like I was rushed or searching and their teamwork​ made this a flawless dining experience​. When you go, GET THE SALMON. I never order Salmon at a restaurant​ but Christian told me it was to die for and OMG FLAVOR EXPLOSION. It was by far the best piece of fish I've had since I lived in Florida over 10 years ago. We were also sent out a ​complimentary dessert and a sparkling wine toast at the end of our meal for our anniversary and it was just so heartwarming​. We happily waddled out of the restaurant​ and it was one of the nicest and romantic dining experiences​ we've ever had. Thank you!"
Gina C.,"Manhattan, NY",4/4/2016,5 star rating,"Came here on a Saturday morning for brunch - if you're trying to do a walk-in during brunch/lunch hours, I suggest you come in at 11 when they open because at 10:45am, there was already a little line forming outside of the doors.Unlike ABC Cocina, the food is not meant to be shared tapas style, although you can certainly do so if you'd like. The portions are tiny, but everything is really good. Between the two of us, we split the scrambled eggs with crispy potatoes, buttermilk pancakes with lemon curd, and eggs benedict with flying pigs farm ham. The scrambled eggs were european style so they were runny on the inside and tasted amazing. Our server was also kind enough to split the eggs benedict for us onto two plates so we could share it. The scrambled eggs and eggs benedict definitely took the cake home.We also had a ginger shot and an iced matcha latte. The iced matcha latte is unsweet and perfectly tastes of pure matcha, as it should.A pricey but great little spot for a fancier brunch. Extra kudos for having the most beautiful interior design!!"
Tina L.,"Portland, OR",4/22/2017,5 star rating,"These are just the things we had, but others could be better we've just not had the chance to try it.  It was pricey alright, our brunch was $120+ with tax and tip, but well worth it.In order of awesomeness:1. Crab aioli on toast2. Fried oysters and scrambled eggs (eggs made with habanero, elderflower syrup, something something vinegar, paprika infused butter)3. Horseradish fluke4. Eggs benedict.  The ham was just crazy umami."
Janice T.,"Manhattan, NY",3/11/2017,5 star rating,"Hands down my favorite restaurant. Gorgeous, romantic interiors that is all purchasable at its home store attached to the back of the restaurant.

Wendy C.,"New York, NY",4/2/2018,2 star rating,"The food was good, but my overall experience here was undeniably subpar as a result of the service. I will not return - in a city filled with delicious dining establishments that actually have great service, ABC Kitchen is a pass in my book.We ordered the crab toast, asparagus and prosciutto whole wheat pizza, and the sea bass. I'm always skeptical of ordering toast at restaurants, as more often than not it ends up being one slice of bread with very minimal toppings and a hefty price tag. However, given the raving reviews about the crab toast, I decided to give it a try. It was very tasty, with the lemon wedges on the side being a key element. There was a good amount of crab atop the four bite-sized pieces of toast and the bread was toasted to perfection. The pizza was also quite good - I enjoyed how the asparagus was cut (piled into thin circular pieces) and the ricotta was great. However, this dish was a too salty for my taste, likely from the prosciutto. The sea bass entrée was great. We were confused by all of the liquid that the spinach was soaking in, but it tasted fine. There were also random bits of very spicy flavor - I enjoyed it, but it was not enjoyable for my friend who couldn't tolerate spice. I really liked the lemon marmalade that came with the sea bass - it really made the dish.Onto the service - we did not appreciate the waitress' continuous attempts at up-selling. It was not professional and felt dishonest. I don't mind spending for quality, but I am against restaurants that lack honesty and integrity, and attempt to swindle their patrons. I expected more from a restaurant like ABC Kitchen.Also, if you sit at the high top tables you will feel a draft given its proximity to the doors. Dress warmly if the weather is chilly."

Jen M.,"Manhattan, NY",12/6/2017,5 star rating,"Came here for a business lunch with a large group (party of 10) - everyone LOVED it!First, I am very sensitive to the noise-level when I am in a business setting; I want everyone to be able to hear each other without having to shout. The noise level here was perfect: not too quiet, not too loud. The decor is beautiful: love the exposed wood beams.We had a prix fix menu -- the favorite dishes were the tuna sashimi, akaushi burger, ricotta ravioli, and the squash with pine nuts. Serving sizes were perfect.Service was on point: we never had an empty glass, dishes were cleared and replaced in a timely manner.Would highly recommend and will definitely be back. Hope to try dinner here one time soon, too."
Inna T.,"Walnut Creek, CA",4/26/2018,3 star rating,"Slightly underwhelming for the cost - had the sea bass which was pretty bland with a few intense jalapeño bites, and the chicken liver pate toast.

Nicole N.,"Brooklyn, NY",1/31/2018,4 star rating,"We had reservations at 2pm but weren't seated until 2:17pm. I was a bit inpatient because I had a meeting afterwards. Nonetheless a host seated us, but we had to wait some more for menus. The waiters all had diff sections, but our waiter forgot to get us menus. The menu is tricky. The restaurant week section is located at the bottom.  It doesn't stand out. We ordered butternut squash soup, seared salmon, portobello mushroom sandwich ( more like a burger) , lemon tart and chocolate cake. ALL THE FOOD IS PHENOMENAL. The cake was crunchy and delectable with a marshmallow burnt crust. The lemon tart was sweet with some tarty berries and some fresh cream. The butternut squash soup was tasty thick and creamy. The entrees were medium rare seared salmon with a fresh velvety salad and light dresssing that added a kick. The portobello mushroom also has a similar sauce but it tasted a lot like mushrooms. Fresh bun too. The decor of the restaurant is barn esque. All the staff wore plaid. I would recommend coming when you're not in a rush and for dates."
Nomad M.,"New York, NY",5/8/2015,4 star rating,"Can't believe it took me so long to come back to ABC Kitchen since my last visit when it was just open! And I am so glad I stopped by today for lunch with my foodie friend. The whole experiences def exceeds expectation.First and foremost, services were impeccable from start to finish.Decor. You would press hard to find other restaurant that is more chic than ABC Kitchen in the city. Now, food! We came here for the Blackboard Eats special menu $32 for 3 courses prefix. First course, I went with the roasted carrots and avocado salad. This is prob the best salad I have had in 2015 so far. The sweet carrots and nutty avocado are mixed with crunchy seeds , sesame dressed in light sour cream and citrus dressing. Healthy and tasty! The lady who sat next to us eye-feasted my salad couple times and I heard her murmured ""that looks great"". Second course, I opted for the crispy skate salad. It is a very colorful dish: golden crispy skate, purple yam chip, deep orange carrots, green romaines and white dill tartar sauce. Love the colors! The taste is even better! The skate is crispy outside and juicy inside, cooked just perfectly. The tartar sauce is lovely, with ginger, dill and hint of spiciness. The portion is big too- dinner size not lunch size. Although I failed to make a dent, I am happily packing it home for dinner :)Although I love my skate, friend's entree is more creative and interesting- ricotta and farm egg raviolo. At first glance, it looks like regular poached egg.  but take a closer look it is so much more than that - it is poached egg wrapped inside ricotta cheese. When cutting it open, the egg yolk is coming out like lava!! Woooo~~ It is #creamy #cheesy and eggy at the same time. Check out the picture. We were so amazed by the creativity and technique. Basically you drop the whole egg in the middle of the ricotta and boil them together. . The pork ragu with chili, sage and Parmesan adds savor to the dish, though if I could I would skip the pork - not a fan. Overall, we are very impressed. Creative idea and flawless execution. At this point, everything feels so perfect. Can it be even better? Yes, it can! Comes the dessert. We opted for the almond cake and salted caramel ice cream sundae with candied popcorn and peanuts. Both are outstanding. I am more in love with the ice cream - i don't even like ice cream in general! It is not too sweet, soft, almost weightless, purely heavenly. Now that I have rekindled my love with ABC Kitchen, surely I will come back more often. Just a tip. You don't necessary come in here with resy on a weekday for lunch. For what i saw, there are plenty tables open at 1pm though OpenTable keep telling you the earliest avail is 2pm :/"
Gia H.,"Los Angeles, CA",9/11/2016,4 star rating,This place is amazing! The ambiance is great. Very romantic. This would definitely be a great date spot. It is pretty dark in here though. The service was impeccable. Marinated olives- we got these to start. They were good. If you like olives then obviously you would like these.Roast Carrot and Avocado Salad - this salad was my favorite thing I tried here! It was crunchy and tangy. Ravioli- this was really good as wellthey were citrusy.
Heather W.,"New York, NY",9/11/2015,1 star rating,"COMPLETELY disappointed:  Service was atrocious.  Waitress acted visibly aggravated THE ENTIRE DINNER, and eye-rolled all over the place.  This set a horrible tone for the evening.Unfortunately it didn't end there- everything came out excruciatingly slowly, and not timed together.  We had some drinks, crab toast, kale salad (very very salty), mushroom pizza, and two fish dishes.  The pizza was cold.  (!!!)  The fish, bland and mediocre.  Really unbelievably disappointing.  Can't imagine being back for any reason."
Saskea O.,"Brooklyn, NY",7/28/2017,3 star rating,"Decided to try this today since it's Restaurant Week. For a party of 4 we only had 2 prix fixe and ordered the remainder from the regular menu. The Fluke was blah, for want of a better word. The kale, even it was not physically appealing, tasted really god. We mixed the two and it actually worked very well. Second course was a salmon dish, soft and buttery, and a pasta dish, drowning in olive oil. The other 2 dishes were a turkey sandwich, which was really good and a mushroom pizza, very nice as well. The deserts were good, but IMHO these dishes were not James Beard worthy.The service was extremely slow, we spent 2.5 hours just completing our meal"
Amanda G.,"Jersey City, NJ",4/28/2015,5 star rating,"I loved coming here. The place was packed and I think they should not have tables set near the bar, it just makes it harder to pass around and if you are just checking the place from the outside you might be put off and give it a pass. The good news though, they have another bar past the main dining area, which I only saw when my table was available.The ambiance was really great, everything seemed in place and in order. The drinks were okayish though I think they should extend their cocktail menu. It's too basic. The food was delicious. I ordered Carbonara and it came with spaghetti. My friend had a lobster. All cooked to perfection. Their dessert menu lacks one thing though. Cheesecake. You gotta have cheesecake. Please bring cheesecake back. The only time I ate less to reserve some space for cheesecake is the time I found out they are some restaurants with no cheesecake in their dessert menu. Please cheesecake I would def. recommend this place for both private and group events/ outing"
June C.,"Hoboken, NJ",4/6/2018,4 star rating,Went to ABC Kitchen in nyc restaurants week for the pre fix lunch 3 course for $29. This restaurant is very fancy. I would say food is generally good and above average but I don't really find anything very special. I like the environment which is very casual and a little laid back. I might not come here again if it weren't restaurants week.
Anna S.,"Corte Madera, CA",10/2/2017,4 star rating,"Dined here with a group of 5 on a Tuesday evening. We've ordered mostly appetizers with a few mains to share. The highlights for me were the crab toast and carrot/avocado salad. Calamari and hake were also good. Based on the hype, I had higher expectations for the other dishes. Interesting decor and good service. Overall, this was a nice experience."
Lisa T.,"Hayward, CA",1/2/2018,3 star rating,"I was pretty disappointed in this place because my friend had hyped it up for me. Ordered the crab toast, fried calamari, lobster truffle and beef truffle. Everything was just ok and overpriced for just ok. Service was decent here. I liked ABC cocina better."
Kirsten C.,"Scotch Plains, NJ",6/9/2017,1 star rating,"Waitress 5 starsDecor 5 stars Food 4 starsBus boy and management 0 starsHad a delicious meal here on a Friday night. The ricotta toast was amazing. However the evening was ruined when the bus boy spilt water, dropped a knife on the floor, repeatedly almost hit me on the head with plates, took the place mats away while we were still at the table and continued to lean on all of us while removing plates from the table. He also dropped out leftovers on the floor in a bag and walked away. When I finally had enough of his rude behavior I said can you please get off of me? When he replied with ""what is your problem"" I knew I needed to write a review. I asked to speak to a manager but one never came over. I did see the manager speaking to the bus boy but never received an apology from either. Will not be returning because of that."
Cindy L.,"Los Angeles, CA",8/16/2015,3 star rating,"Came here a 2nd time, this time the food was a little let down :( ordered the sweet onion baked prosciutto pizza which was way too salty, also ordered the ravioli in tomato sauce which was very mediocre..last but not least order the pesto pine nut spaghetti which was the best, but a little oily for the sauce."
Helena G.,"Mount Vernon, NY",8/3/2018,5 star rating,Restaurant heaven...Went as graduation present with dear friend and daughter...ALL ITEMS EXCELLENT!Staff Lovely!Beautiful interior.  Wished the portions were larger...but that's about my only issue!
Matt L.,Hong Kong,4/1/2015,3 star rating,"Came to ABC Kitchen on a Tuesday afternoon at around 1:00 PM for lunch, waited about 45 minutes for a table of two.The decor in ABC is basically what you'd expect from your standard brunch place- very hip with a kind of natural feel to it. The food here is (unsurprisingly) very organic, and at the back of their menus they source all their food (eg. their eggs come from a particular free range chicken farm in Connecticut).It seems like they occasionally run out of items, so you may want to go earlier in the day for actual brunch items. We ordered the Portabello mushroom and the crab toast with lemon aioli to start, and we shared a ricotta and farm egg raviolo. The portabello mushroom was straight up just one mushroom, so I felt a little gyped on that one. The crab toast was great, a must get. The ricotta farm egg raviolo was very small, and very expensive.Overall you pay for the ambiance and the fact that you can tell your friends you've been to ABC, right?"
Alina A.,"San Fernando Valley, CA",8/26/2017,5 star rating,"Loved this place! Such a beautiful restaurant. The restaurant appears small and quant from the outside, but once you walk in it's big and bustling.All white with chandeliers hanging and mismatched China. I would have taken photos but we were there for dinner, it would have done no justice.In terms of food everything we got was delicious, the dessert being my favorite. Food:*crab toast: yummy! A bit heavy but worth it*angel hair pasta: this was good, but definitely my least favorite. If I remember correctly it had saffron and jalapeños. Unlike any flavor combo I've had before.*jalapeño burger: delish! Satisfying, juicy, and a delicious bun. The bun is important, people!*salted Carmel sundae: yummmm!!! This ice cream Sunday comes with popcorn all over it and that was the perfect flavor/texture combo for me. Loved it!Great drinks! Great atmosphere! Really loved."
Sharon O.,"San Diego, CA",11/12/2015,5 star rating,"Best restaurant I've tried in New York. The interior is beautiful, it's like walking into a dream! All of the food is super fresh, organic, and locally grown, which I love. Each dish we ordered was amazing and clearly well thought out.Appetizers: - Shaved raw fluke- really good if you like sashimi and olives. Good even if you don't.- Roasted carrot and avocado salad- great citrusy dressing. Fresh avocado, perfectly roasted carrots. We got two orders of this.- Kombucha squash toast*- more on this later.Entrees:- Sea bass- my least favorite dish of the night, which was my entree. A little too salty/ oily for my taste. Was just all right.- Salmon- nice touch with sunflower? pumpkin? seeds on top of the fish. Green apple purée is refreshing, but beware of the spaghetti squash because it has a lot of ginger in it!- Halibut- best fish of the night. The crispy potatoes & sauce it came with were delicious!* Back to the kombucha squash toast!! This was my favorite dish by far. The squash and ricotta is a wonderful collab of sweet and savory, with the apple cider vinegar adding a tangy touch, which all come together to form perfection on a toast. Seriously one of the best things I've ever eaten. With each bite I thanked God for bringing me into this earth so that I could try this toast. I tried to eat slowly to savor the experience. I will be dreaming of this toast tonight and for many moons to come."
Stephanie W.,"Los Angeles, CA",5/4/2013,5 star rating,"Can every restaurant be just as good as ABC Kitchen? I wish... but it would be impossible. Fresh ingredients, rich flavor without feeling overfilled, and a great Anthropologie-esque vibe.I highly reccomend the bacon asparagus pizza. To DIE for. I was afraid it would be overpriced because of all the hype and celebrity spottings... I mean I spied Jake Gyllenhal (yum) while I was there... but it's very reasonable."
Milou I.,"Brownsville, TX",5/25/2018,5 star rating,"First time here, the food was delicious but it did have a long wait time. To drink ordered the freshly squeezed red juice with beets, it was chill and had a really good taste. Will be returning"
Tiffany L.,"Gainesville, VA",8/23/2015,5 star rating,"Excellent food, service, and interior! The space was really big and I loved that everything was white which gave off a clean and fancy, but modern feel. Our servers did their job extremely well-- quick, kind, and made us feel comfortable. Now the food-- we ordered a lot of food for two people. -Raw Nantucket Bay Scallop- fresh and melts in your mouth (i'm not a huge fan of scallops but these left me wanting more)-Tomato toast- I'm not sure if this is on the menu but it was a compliment from the chef. the tomatoes were sliced thinly and drizzled with olive oil and some spices. Simple but delicious!-Green beans with hazelnuts- another one that i'm not sure if i saw on the menu but it was excellent. the hazelnuts gave a nice crunch and the green beans were firm and tender-Spring Onion Baked Prosciutto Pizza- AMAZING! I came with high expectations for the pizza and it was above and beyond. i think it has bbq sauce instead of tomato sauce which went really well with the onions, arugula, and prosciutto. also loved the thin, buttery crust!-Red Snapper- i only had a bite of this because i'm not a huge fan of fish. it was good but probably not something i would order for myself.-Akaushi Cheeseburger- by the time this came out, I was rather full but overall very flavorful and unique flavor from the herbed mayo-Basil Panna Cotta- my friend ordered this and devoured it. i took a bite but the basil was a little too strong for me to enjoy as a dessert-Salted Caramel Ice Cream Sundae- after reading all the awesome reviews about this dessert, i had to get it.... and the hype is real. the ice cream has a particular salted caramel flavor, not like the artificial, overly-sweet ice cream. the popcorn gives a nice crunch and adds a little more sweetness to the over all concoction. All in all, i enjoyed the experience and would come again to try everything else (esp the crab toast)!"
Weili H.,"New York, NY",4/24/2017,4 star rating,"I have to thank my friend for waiting over an hour for a table while we looked for parking on a Saturday afternoon when the police blocked pretty much every other corner of the streets in the area, finally we went in and the hosts were ready to sit us. The space is probably over 2,000 square feet, it's not one of those narrow-halled, squishy and dim rooms so popular in the city, despite the fact that there were many guests in and out and servers running around, the three of us (one pregnant) got to sit at a HUGE table in the back...thank you.Their staff is very kind, we got there kinda late, they close after the 3pm brunch crowd and we were accommodated until 4pm, our waitress had to leave when we were still chatting (that's what happens when you have 3 ladies at one table), she professionally introduced another waiter (his name is Levi and he's very cute and polite).I think the pictures of the interior speak for itself, BUT the chairs seem cheaper than they look, it's got an Anthropologie atmosphere, but very festive at the same time, our table looked like a tree cut in the middle, our plates consist of English tea sets and interesting shapes, a nice mixture of table wear.Let's get down to the food, I know it's probably an exaggeration, but they make the best house fries with herbs, they are so tiny but probably fried in miracles (olive oil maybe? or better) and sauteed to perfection. Very nice texture as well. Another appetizers were fried calamari, served in spicy and herbal mayo, crab meat overload on crispy toasts, they are not the most innovative, but it's the thoughts and details put into creating and perfecting these dishes. They are very flavorful.We had the hake, tender meats with crispy skin, ricotta ravioli, great texture and very creamy, also sea bass, very yummy, and a side of crispy but sweet french toast goodness to share. We wiped the table, and were so full with joy. Slightly on the more expensive side, their menu isn't too out of the box, but if they sell a huge quantity of each, all the plates must be the top of their kind."
Jorge P.,"New York, NY",3/31/2018,4 star rating,"Waiting time is not bad at all if you make a reservation ahead of time. Food was great and value as well (I did the lunch prix fixe for $34). My favorite dish was the seared salmon, it comes with avocado, radish and lettuce. I was not a big fan of the lettuce, took the beauty of the dish away. The utensils are vintage which makes the dishes even more appealing. Overall, a good place for lunch, make sure to allocate enough time to eat here as the whole meal took 1.5 hrs."
Hayley L.,"Wellesley, MA",12/28/2015,5 star rating,"Oh. My. God. If you have to eat one thing for the rest of your life, it is the mashed potatoes here. I did not know mashed potatoes could be so darn delicious. They're a side item for $9 and they're worth every penny. Served in a pool of melted butter and topped with soft white cheese and sea salt -- I was in Food Heaven.I also had the scallops with cranberry sauce/dressing (from the seasonal Winter 2015 menu -- an appetizer) and although the scallops were tiny, they were also so good.My sister had the green pesto pasta with Brussels sprouts and was extremely happy with her meal, too! She had a drink at the bar (a drink invented by one of the bartenders there! can't remember the name) and was also happy with that. All the drinks appeared to be carefully and well made.I ate here on Christmas Day for lunch and we sat at the bar (because we did not have a reservation). Regardless, the bartenders here were so nice (and funny!) and extremely helpful when we asked advice about the menu. The other rooms also looked beautiful, trendy, and well-decorated -- I can't wait to come back here and try the other rooms!"
Christine A.,"San Francisco, CA",6/24/2017,5 star rating,Dear ABC Kitchen:  Please move to SF. I still dream of the roasted hake with shiitake mushrooms.Our waitress picked up the fact that we were there to celebrate a graduation and was kind enough to send a complimentary dessert at the end of the meal. Beautiful restaurant decor.Would definitely come back!
Sara W.,"San Francisco, CA",9/7/2018,3 star rating,"Paid $27 for a salad with salmon. The avocado came brown and gross. I asked for replacement avocado, which wasn't much better. For a restaurant of this caliber, they really should know better. Shame! Shame!  Everything else was quite good."
Kath K.,"New York, NY",2/24/2019,1 star rating,"Went here for brunch today and from start to finish, it was a very disappointing experience. First of all, I did tell the waiter that it was my first time dining here and I did want to see his suggestions on what to order. He was not helpful at all.  Did not recommend anything on the menu to us. Since our waiter was of no help at all, we ordered the mushroom pizza. It was good, nothing to rave about, I have definitely had better pizza. Our waiter came over again while we were eating the pizza, asked what else we wanted, we said we don't know yet. With an attitude, he says ""is that ALL you will be ordering?""..... (people do NOT like to be rushed during their brunches)Then, we made a mistake of listening to our waiter who said the winter squash campanelle was ""delicious"" when we asked about it. It was one of the worst dishes I have EVER had in my life. The squash was NOT cooked and the taste of it was just terrible. On that note, we decided it would be best to get the check, considering we had poor food as well as poor service.  I was so excited to try this overly hyped restaurant. I expected much more for such a high caliber restaurant. I will never be dining here again."
Sebastian S.,"New York, NY",2/15/2016,4 star rating,"We were really excited to try this restaurant being a fan of the Chef Jean-Georges. It's been in the list for a while but finally got the chance the experience it and a great experience it was.It's a large space, right under the ABC Carpet. Entrance is on 18th street through a bar area. You can also enter from the ABC Carpet's main entrance on Broadway during business hours. Dining room was packed on Thursday night dinner at 8pm. It was somewhat loud so it wasn't that easy to keep a conversation going and also dimly lit.Menu has a lot of options, grouped by market table, appetizers, pasta, pizzas, entrees and sides. A lot to go over before making a decision but so many excellent dishes which makes it hard to just pick one for each course. It was group of us so decided to get bunch of dishes and try different dishes as much as we could manage.Here are some of the dishes we enjoyed; roasted beets, house-made ricotta, crab toast, tuna sashimi, kale salad, calamari, raw fluke, salmon, hake, chicken and the pork confit with mushrooms, brussels sprouts and braised cabbage for sides (didn't have room for pastas or pizzas this time).Start with cocktails or wine then share everything. Wine list is very approachable with variety of options from low to high pricing and most major wine regions. Overall great night with delicious food, service lacked at certain times due to the volume of diners and table turnover rate but still very accommodating and courteous.Look forward to returning."
Olivia R.,"New York, NY",1/12/2016,4 star rating,"Enjoyed a great meal here! Tip: must make reservation in advance, esp if you want to go during the weekend! The crab toast is just as good as everyone says. It is very refreshing, and I dont even love crab. The carrot avocado salad was good but nothing amazing - next time I will try something different. For entree I got the burger. The burger was good, but I am not a big burger person. It is very cheesy and comes with jalepenos (ask for them on the side if you dont like spicy). Overall a pricey but good meal. The atmosphere is great too - dim lighting and feels intimate even though it is a big space."
Joseph P.,"New York, NY",9/2/2017,5 star rating,Great knowledgeable waitstaff. Nice ambiance presenting elegant farm to table feel. Food was delicious.  Very nice experience
Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",7/23/2012,5 star rating,"This place is pricy, but well worth it.You may have to wait, but we were lucky enough to get in immediately. They did stick us in the back though (I think we didn't look hipstery/food snobby enough), near the ABC Kitchen store that is attached to the restaurant, which is pretty weird, but who cares about that. The food is amazing.Here's what we feasted on:- Bread and olive oilThis is some pretty tasty complimentary bread they give you to get you through the few minutes of perusing the menu until the order is in and the food comes.- Chicken liver toast:This is a really rich, delicious way to start the meal. The chicken liver is smooth and  very satisfying and the bread is really nice and crispy. An excellent combination.- Kasha and bowtie pasta with veal meatballs:This is one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had. The veal meatballs are juicy, soft and extremely flavorful. Luckily we had some bread left, which was perfect for soaking up the amazing sauce from the pasta and the meatballs.- House roasted turkey sandwich with fries:This was a really awesome sandwich. The bread was nice and hot and crispy and the turkey and avocado were delicious. The fries were fancy McDonald's style and were delicious with the fancy ketchup they provided.- Sundae (salted caramel ice cream, candied peanuts and popcorn, whipped cream, hot fudge):This was the perfect ending to an amazing meal. This is one of the few times I've seen a dessert done right with popcorn. I have tried several such desserts, and the popcorn usually ends up soggy or stale tasting, which was definitely not the case here. This dish gives you one of the most perfect bites possible: crunchy popcorn, some nice salty peanuts, smooth and creamy delicious ice cream, and the hot fudge to round it all out. I would come back here again just to get this dessert.I highly recommend coming here - you will not regret it, as long as you save room for that dessert."

Yimei M.,"New York, NY",1/30/2015,5 star rating,"Cheers to the New Year! At last, I've tried you, ABC Kitchen. I now have one more restaurant checked off in my book, ""1001 Restaurants to Try Before You Die""! Woot Woot! Service, food, and the atmosphere were all very welcoming. The restaurant was rustic, yet chic. The only thing that I'm uncertain about is the peep into their furniture store that takes out the romance, rustic, and chic feel of the restaurant. The food and cocktails were amazing. How you not love a Jean-George restaurant? I would highly recommend roasted cod with cauliflower, crushed herbs and lime if you enjoy good aromatics. The sautéed skuna bay salmon, weet and spicy carrot sauce, roasted carrots and basil was also good. Opt for that if you are feeling more on the sweet side. Keep in mind that restaurants of this stature comes at a price, so also feel free to get a side. Accompany your meal with their well-known cocktails. The big apple was more than your average martini. It delivered more of a ginger aroma and sudden sweetness. The sour cherry old fashioned would be more for those die-hard artificial lovers, or for those that enjoy the taste of cough syrup. Always ask your server for suggestions! It'll never go wrong. Enjoy!"
Nelson W.,"New York, NY",6/30/2012,5 star rating,"So much has been said about quality of ABC Kitchen's menu such that any adjectives will simply be commonplace and redundant. Everyone knows about the akaushi burger, the whole wheat pizzas, and beautiful salads.  If hundreds of reviews do not already gush about these choice selections, the photos will simply clinch that.This review only serves two purposes: one - just to add a 5-rating for the establishment for its great food, ambiance, and service; two - to give much deserved recognition to the wonderful staff.  The level of attentiveness at ABC Kitchen is unmatched. From basic tasks such as asking about how your food is to refilling your water, the staff does so in such discreet yet persistent manner.  Your conversation at the table never feels interrupted at any point.  In my latest visit, my water was refilled about eight times without fail.  Moreover, a casual mention (to my party) of my lack of ability to imbibe a drink was picked up by two separate waitresses. Each waitress came up to ask about my satisfaction level from the drink and then proceeded to take my drink away even though there was no formal complaint from me at all.  Beautifully done, especially when it was never requested. Attentive, friendly, understanding, consistent, and lovely smiles. One star each for having the art of service on full display. Wonderful."
Mandy T.,"AZ, AZ",11/13/2017,4 star rating,"I love the ambiance here, shabby chic. Had so much fun here for mimosa brunch. Food was great. Service was slow though but the place was packed on a weekend so understandable. Will definitely be back."
Janus C.,"New York, NY",10/1/2015,4 star rating,"As claimed, I came back here for a visit for a quality check (my lame excuse of allowing myself to nom).The lunch menu is so great for its value. My friend ordered the pre-fixe lunch (appetizer, entree and dessert) and the choices were decent (most of the choices were on the regular menu).I love the crab toast here. The toast is a bit too crispy for my taste, but the crab pieces are fresh and come in huge lumps. Off of one order, I almost get full on this. I also got the mushroom pizza, which was mediocre. The runny farm egg was a nice touch, but  I got tired of this pizza after one slice.My friend ordered the tuna sashimi (very good, but heavily seasoned), the portobello burger (I'd advise against this. This was probably the most disappointing dish of our lunch) and the caramel popcorn sundae (the salted caramel ice cream is good, but it isn't as amazing as other Yelpers make it sound. It's a bit rich for a lunch dessert.)The service is up and down. Our busser poured water all over our table and kept unnecessarily rearranging dishes. Our server always seemed busy, as we didn't see her too many times and we had to flag her down several times (to order and to get our check), but she was attentive otherwise.Still one of my favorite restaurants. The decor to the second floor is beautiful, and the food is definitely worth it. This is high-quality dining without the pretentious feel of most nice restaurants."
Jina C.,"San Francisco, CA",11/11/2015,4 star rating,"Such a cute place! It was hardly noticeable from the street though, since the sign was small and white with thin lettering. The place was actually very spacious inside with several dining areas. I loved the decor, with rustic and earthy accents. I also liked that all the servers wore plaid button-down's. As far as service was concerned, we had multiple servers come tend to our table, and everyone was cordial. The food was great overall. We ordered the Crab Toast with Lemon Aioli and Wood Oven Roasted Maine Lobster with Oregano and Lemon-Chili Vinaigrette. Both were delicious. The ingredients tasted fresh and everything complemented each other nicely. We were wishing the portions were bigger! My friend got a glass of Grapefruit Juice, which was also really good. One downside of our visit was the 15-minute wait despite having reservations."
Kevin A.,"Palo Alto, CA",2/1/2018,5 star rating,"We loved everything about this place. I accidentally booked a reservation for ABC Cocina, which is the Mexican sister restaurant to ABC Kitchen. I love Mexican food but not tapas and the Cocina is a tapas restaurant. I explained my mistake to the front desk and asked the if they could squeeze us in at the Kitchen, and they had us seated within 5 minutes! This was on a Saturday night. We ordered:-ricotta pear compote - A+ .. this was soo good spread on the lightly toasted bread it came with. -kale salad - also amazing. -ravioli - sauce was rich and tasty. Would order again.-fusilli - my least favorite thing, but still pretty good. The sausage was spicy which was great. But I wouldn't order this again."
Ziyan C.,"San Francisco, CA",7/11/2012,4 star rating,"Great atmosphere. Simple but sophisticated decor. I like their eclectic mix of dinnerware that still all somehow goes together. And even though I spilled my water twice, they were so friendly and never made me feel one bit bad about it.While the food was really good and I enjoyed my dinner, ~~MARKET TABLE~~* Crab toast - 3.5 starsyelp.com/biz_photos/dMhR…(with lemon aioli. $15)Toast was a little hard and stale, but the crab was hearty, fresh, and that little dollop of aioli on top delectable. * Chicken liver toast - 3 starsyelp.com/biz_photos/dMhR…($11)Like the crab, the toast was a little hard and stale. The liver was good, a little too homogeneous though - I like really tasting that grainy texture in liver. Also I would recommend only getting one of the two toast apps - having both, they're a little too similar. ~~APPETIZERS~~* Roast carrot and avocado salad - 3 starsyelp.com/biz_photos/dMhR…(w/ crunchy seeds, sour cream and citrus. $15)Good & fresh ingredients. Solid but not super unique or spectacular - while the salad tasted great, I would order something else had I the chance to repeat this dinner since there were so many great choices on the menu.~~PASTAS~~* Housemade ricotta ravioli - 4 starsyelp.com/biz_photos/dMhR…(w/ herbs and tomato sauce. $15)This was fantastic! Though a simple, classic dish - incredibly well made and one of the highlights of the night.~~WHOLE WHEAT PIZZAS~~* Asparagus pizza - 4 starsyelp.com/biz_photos/dMhR…yelp.com/biz_photos/dMhR…(w/ bacon, ricotta, parmesan and black pepper. $17)Also really nice! The crust was super thin and baked just right. It has the right amount of crisp to hold well and yet the bread still had a soft, chewy texture.~~ENTREES~~* Organic crispy chicken - 3 starsyelp.com/biz_photos/dMhR…(w/ escarole, chilies and lemon. $28)The chicken itself was tasty and moist. I'm not convinced it was worth what we paid, especially since the sides weren't particularly wow-ing or enhancing to its flavor.* Roast suckling pig - 4 starsyelp.com/biz_photos/dMhR…(w/ smoked bacon marmalade and grilled baby leeks. $34)Ohhh so nice, fatty, such good meat. The bacon marmalade was a little tart for my taste, by my friends were all drooling over it.~~DESSERTS~~* Sundae - 4 starsyelp.com/biz_photos/dMhR…(salted caramel ice cream. candied peanuts & popcorn, whipped cream, chocolate sauce. $13)Nice! A good heavy sweet & savory dessert. Not usually a sweet & savory fan here, but when it's done right, I enjoy it as I did with this dish. The chocolate sauce was really intense and thick. All the textures and flavors went together really well.* Almond tart - 3 starsyelp.com/biz_photos/dMhR…(with orange cream. $9)A big disappointment. We wanted something lighter and with a different flavor than our other dessert, but we should have just stuck with the sundae. We thought this would have a much stronger fruit flavor, but it was mostly like a sweet pie. While this was well made, it doesn't really stand as a unique dessert out or add to the meal."
Lisa F.,"Brooklyn, NY",12/10/2019,5 star rating,Perfect anniversary dinner thanks to amazing food and amazing service from Emily! I sat at the bar waiting for my husband to join and had the pleasure of being served by one of the nicest bar tenders/waitresses/ general all around nice person Emily. She was so welcoming and warm and made me feel so comfortable sitting alone for 25 min waiting for my husband (i got there early). We decided to forgo the table and eat at the bar just so we could have her as our waitress! Everyone should be like her. She made our anniversary so special and we can't that her and the staff at ABC Kitchen enough for making it such a memorable night! We'll definitely be back!!
Maria A.,"Brooklyn, NY",5/5/2017,4 star rating,"Went here for lunch what a cool place exclamation mark I'm definitely adding this place to my usual rotation when I'm around Union Square it's very easy to get to and once you do the restaurant is massive and bustling the decor is very white and wood with touches of eclectic Romance.Everything on the menu is clean and fresh. I tried the crab toast with lemon aoli --- full of flavor! They're generous with the portion of crab too and it's so lovely cold on the crunchy buttery toast. I had the angel hair pasta with ricotta as my main, again light and delicious! I will say that the pasta was missing a bit of acid, it could have maybe used a bit of lemon. My colleague got the bibb salad for appetizer and the sea bass as an entree. The fish portion was perfect and the was perfectly cooked!Their drinks are also very unique they have a variety of Virgin sodas and housemaid juices I had too matcha iced tea and the ginger and lime soda. I can't wait to come back to try some more! It's great that they offer a half portion of everything also. I can go on and on so I'll stop here. Just go!"
Lauren P.,"Seattle, WA",6/22/2018,5 star rating,"So I know that everyone loves this place, and it has so much buzz around the city I just had to try. And much to my liking it was quite a treat.I met a group of friends here for brunch and would say from the second that I arrived until the moment I left I enjoyed myself thoroughly. They focus on hospitality but also serve amazing farm to table in a sophisticated environment. Highly recommend!"
Catherine C.,"Little Neck, Queens, NY",1/22/2018,5 star rating,"I came here with a party of 7 for a birthday dinner. We were seated right away as soon as everyone had arrived. The atmosphere here was really nice, and even romantic if you come here for a date night. We ordered a bunch of appetizers to share, which were all delicious: crab toast, roast carrot and avocado salad, and a small casarecce with fennel sausage pasta. For my entree, I ordered the akaushi cheeseburger which was amazing. How can they make a cheeseburger taste even better? Quite amazed. I also ordered this fuji apple ginger drink which was surprisingly delicious. For dessert we got the sundae which did not disappoint. I asked the waiter if he can put a candle on it for the birthday boy, and he actually brought out a chocolate cupcake with a candle, and wrote happy birthday on the plate. The presentation was beautiful. I'd definitely come back here. The service is amazing and the food is delicious! The atmosphere is very pleasant, great to bring a date or to celebrate a special event!"
Mia M.,"Brooklyn, NY",9/9/2017,5 star rating,"Great place, great food, great service. Went here for a date. Comfortable enough for my date and I to be here for hours until they closed after lunch. It was such a great ambiance and the restaurant seems to attract a great people. Our waiter was nice enough to introduce our new waiter before his shift ended and told us he enjoyed serving us before saying goodbye. Some restaurants don't do this and the new waiter will normally just introduce him/herself on their own-- so, little things like this make me appreciate the service and bump it up to 5 stars. I had the sea bass (I can still taste that fresh dill!), the mushroom pizza (loved it), and their wine selections are great! Everything is fresh and I can remember what the food tasted and felt like. I'll go back."
Grace W.,"Long Island City, New York, NY",12/17/2017,5 star rating,"Not easy to get a reservation for a decent time slot of a bigger group at this Jean-Georges organic farm to table restaurant, but it was worth every effort to try even we could only get in for an early 5:30pm dinner.Very delicious food! We had the crab toast, pizza, roasted beets, raw fluke, pork and chicken sausage as appetizer. And my pasta with fennel sausage entree has a little spice kick in it, soooo yummy!"
Sophie N.,"New York, NY",5/25/2017,2 star rating,"OVERHYPED and OVERRATED! Came here with two girlfriends for a dinner reservation at 5:30pm and the place was not even packed but they didn't offer to seat us unless our full party was here, fine - acceptable. We ordered the food and drinks - nothing special at all - it's supposed to be French and New American - not even close - seems like traditional American instead. Totally not wowed by the food and the price tag that came with it. I've eaten at Daniel's, Brushstroke and Del Posto and all of these places, I actually didn't mind paying for food that was worthwhile. I also went to their sister property ABC Cocina and that was so much better - I will return there but definitely not to ABC Kitchen. What a joke for the price and the food that was provided. Definitely Thumbs Down."
Colleen P.,"Chicago, IL",12/12/2017,5 star rating,"Oh so delicious!We celebrated a friend's birthday here and it was perfection!I was going back and forth between the chicken and the pork confit, but eventually decided in the pork. So glad I did! It was the best I've had compared to several other restaurants.I also had the fig martini. I wasn't a fan, but the two margaritas I ordered after made up for it! The deserts were amazing too. We ordered the apple pie and ice cream sundae - oh so good! The waitress was helpful and the environment speaks for itself. Loved it!"
Jonah K.,"Pompano Beach, FL",10/22/2017,3 star rating,"Been here a couple times. It's always busy and it's a large space attached to essentially a high end store. The food here is well done with good organic ingredients. This last meal was a lunch. I had a ricotta stuffed ravioli, and it was good, but there wasn't enough sauce. It was decent but not amazing."
Nicole S.,"New York, NY",3/18/2017,5 star rating,"Great brunch. With awesome selection of appetizers, breakfast and lunch entrees. It was so hard to choose so we ordered a bit of everything! For appetizers we did Squash toast which was like fall on a plate. my favorite was the crab toast, so fresh. the pretzel calamari with spicy marinara and a mustard sauce. The cured meat and cheeses, which came with thick brown mustard and honey omg! What an amazing combination!, the tuna sashimi was some of the best and freshest tuna I've had in a while. We all shared the pizza with mushrooms and farm egg, and the dough was so chewy and delicious. The egg on top was really perfection. I had the eggs Benedict with a delicious ham, it was the quintessential delicious eggs bene! What did everyone else have? The burger, turkey sandwich, lobster, bow ties with veal meat balls. Everyone raved about their dishes! We also orders the cheddar biscuits for a side dish, major deliciousness! For dessert I had the almond creme brûlée and tried some of the cookie plate, with a cappuccino. The creme brûlée was one of the best I've had in a very long time, same with the cappuccino! For drinks I started with a healthy Green juice,  and switched to a "" healthy"" ginger margarita, both were refreshing and amazing. This place is a must try."
Brittany T.,"San Jose, CA",6/7/2013,4 star rating,"When visiting New York I wanted a place that was pretty fancy but not super expensive and something with a unique and awesome atmosphere.All of their food is organic and fresh, an open kitchen with herbs and some veggies displayed out front makes you feel like it's from the farm to your table.ATMOSPHERE: It was JUST what I wanted. Rustic, vintage, low lighting with candles everywhere.  The lights that were strung or hanging from the ceiling were all low lit and almost like a light bulb that was strung inside a mining cave.Each table had a little flower in a unique vase/holder and a real candle.  Seating was around long supporting poles.  FOOD: I heard so much about the carrot and avocado salad and thought, how could a veggie salad get any better but it was so good! The seasonings on the carrot were out of this world, very tasty and the avocado so fresh and tasty.  I got the halibut - it was pretty tasty, for a fish.  I usually don't like fish but the sauce it sat in was almost like a soup, and quite tasty.My boyfriend got the fried chicken - he said it was the best fried chicken he's ever had.  It was very light and airy, but still crispy.  The outside almost reminded me of that taro fried ball (wu-gok) in dim sum.  The sauce it sits in was a spicy yellow cream sauce.Boyfriend's sister got the bowtie pasta.  Very tasty as well and the veal meatballs were perfectly seasoned.Boyfriend's sister's boyfriend (lol) got the asparagus pizza.  The crust was perfectly thin and crusty and the bacon...OH THE BACON, so tasty and thickly cut.  I like it crispy but this one was almost like a ham piece.  Overall this place was great, totally lived up to it's expectations.  I would recommend this for 20 somethings looking for a mid expensive restaurant with a trendy/unique atmosphere and good food."
Michelle B.,"Frisco, TX",7/18/2012,5 star rating,"Near-perfect restaurants are far and few between these days.  ABC Kitchen, from delicious food to attentive service, comes pretty close.  It's no coincidence that ABC Kitchen is part of Jean-Georges Vongerichten's acclaimed restaurant group. Head Chef Dan Kluger delivers  a satiable menu that is sure to please any palate.  I had to make reservations about a month in advance, but I knew upon entering the warm and rustic restaurant, it was well worth it.My friend and I were seated immediately.  We perused the menu and decided to split two appetizers.  We started with the Crab Toast.  Charred bread and fresh, chunky crab served with lemon aioli.  The crunch of the toast and the creaminess of the crab presented a light but satisfying appetizer.In addition to the Crab Toast, I wanted to try one of their many whole wheat pizzas.  I had trouble deciding which one to get.  The server recommended the Mushrooms, Parmesan, Oregano and Farm Egg Pizza.  I hate when server's say they like everything.  I am very appreciative when a server can recommend one or two particularly delicious dishes.  The egg served as a sauce-like topping on the already flavorful thin-crust pizza.For the entrée, I got the Red Snapper with chilies, herbs, baby market potatoes and spinach.  Lightly grilled fish with a kick.  It was served in a delicious broth, which was suitable to sip on its own.  The potatoes and spinach absorbed the savory broth, only enhancing its flavor.Finally, the crème de la crème.  The Caramel Sundae.  This is not an ordinary sundae, my friends.  This mouth-watering dessert is made of salted caramel ice cream, candied peanuts & popcorn, whipped cream, and chocolate sauce.  I love the mix of salty and sweet so this was a perfect sundae in my eyes.ABC Kitchen is most definitely one of NYC's top new restaurants."
Zoe H.,"Brooklyn, NY",7/17/2017,4 star rating,Love this place! The drinks and the food are amazing.I did have their donuts and a meal and got diarrhea after which was odd but to be honest it was worth it. I've gone back again and will continue to do so!
H H.,"Los Angeles, CA",4/22/2017,5 star rating,"Just go....  they have it down to a science.Since yelp says my review is to short and would not post, here is my tip.  Late lunch is wonderful..  they close between lunch and dinner, so everything seems to be more relaxed."
Timmy L.,"Jamaica, NY",2/16/2016,4 star rating,"Came here also on a weekday during restaurant week. Place was packed.Decor is nice... very unique. It seemed like every room (place is a lot bigger than I anticipated) had a different sort of industrial theme.Service was good. Food was good. Had appetizers, a cocktail, kale salad mushroom sandwich and tuna sashimi with dessert. Sandwich I think was the best bite out of the bunch. Overall nothing to complain about but was not overly blown away by everything."
Candace M.,"Long Beach, CA",9/9/2015,4 star rating,"Holy whole wheat pizza, batman! This thing was so delicious, if I had not had the cheese & meat plate, grilled bread & olive oil and salmon toast before hand, I would have finished this all by myself. The cheese was so tasty, the mushrooms were full of flavor and the crust was perfectly cooked. And to top it off, it had a fried egg in the center. The crushed red pepper was the perfect flavor to add... Could not say more good things about it. Only reason is got 4 stars were the doughnuts. I'm a huge fan of all doughnuts, but these left me unsatisfied and wishing I had ordered the cookies."
Rachel C.,"Boston, MA",5/27/2019,5 star rating,Sitting in the restaurant as I am writing this review. Absolutely delicious. Ordered the crab toast and a side of asparagus - the portion sizes are decent so both filled me up. The flavors are top notch and all the food is very fresh. Service is great too!
Lila H.,"Los Angeles, CA",9/9/2010,5 star rating,"101!I loved everything about this place-the decor was so pretty as well as the food.We came on Sunday for brunch and our waiter was super friendly and very enthusiastic which is hard to come by nowadays.  The Peekytoe crab toast was amazing and we each got a bite since its cut up in fours.I ended up choosing the housemade yogurt with granola and market berries (which were the tiny strawberries) and a scone.  Everything was light and fresh.Everyone else loved their dish-portabello sandwich, mushroom pizza, and french toast.  I really liked their sautéed corn, manchego, jalapeños and lime side-which the waiter explained to us how to make at home.I consider this place as one of those ""special places"" and will have to return on my next visit to NY to try more things on the menu."
David C.,"East Brunswick, NJ",9/3/2012,5 star rating,"This was my second foray to ABC Kitchen, and yes that means it is spectacular! The local farm ingredients are super fresh and I like the fact that we are supporting the local economy.The highlights are the suckling pig which was very savory and melts in your mouth and the homemade soda - I had the basil lime... Ahh refreshing! It does get a little noisy but the atmosphere is very chill."
Jessie I.,"Caldwell, NJ",12/30/2015,5 star rating,"Though this review is extremely delayed, I am writing it purely because I still talk about the meal I had here in July of this past summer. My friend and I wanted to try something new in the city after work. So, on a Thursday night, dinner time, we ventured to ABC Kitchen to see what all of the hype was about. The decor of this restaurant alone is amazing- I can't even begin to describe it, but it was very whimsical and intriguing, however did not take away from the meal itself at all. My friend and I have very similar tastes when it comes to the food we like, so we wanted to split most plates that we ordered. We ordered the pretzel calamari and roasted carrot salad as appetizers. The calamari came with two sauces, and the calamari was done just right. The carrots in the salad were cooked to perfection and were extremely tasty. As I had said, my friend and I had wanted to split the entrees we ordered: the fried chicken and cheeseburger. Our waitress had the kitchen pre-split our dishes, so we each got our own plate with half of the main dish on it. We were so happy they did this! The chicken was out of this world- fried chicken is not something I usually go out and order, but since we were splitting it, I decided to give it a try... and I'm SO glad I did. The sauce it was in was not too buttery and had a definite kick to it, which I liked because I enjoy spicy food. The cheeseburger was also amazing, and they even gave us each our own ketchup and french fries. It's safe to say that we both finished every last crumb of our food. And how could we leave without getting dessert? Our social media ""research"" of ABC Kitchen showed us that the salted caramel sundae would be the winner for dessert. Again, AMAZING! Though ABC Kitchen is on the pricer side (and I was an unpaid intern at the time of dining), this is a meal I tell everyone about, especially for its service, ambiance, and of course, food. I will definitely be returning to ABC Kitchen in the future."
Allen W.,"Manhattan, NY",2/6/2018,5 star rating,"You must try crab toast, calamari, and mushroom pizza there! The atmosphere is relaxing and service are good! Expect a little bit wait if not make reservation 2 weeks ahead, very busy like everyday."
Jenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",3/22/2017,4 star rating,"I had high expectations when I came here since it feels like it takes forever to get a reservation here. It was hard to find - or perhaps it's because I need a new prescription for my lens. But I digress -- once found, it's hard to miss. When you walk in, the seating area is beautiful. The lighting makes the ambiance more casual and romantic. I'd imagine they would light up candles at night which would make the restaurant more on the romantic side. My friend and I were seated promptly after I told the ladies that I had a reservation for 2 at 1PM. A funny side note - the chairs are NOT coat friendly. When I walked to my seat, I saw a few jackets fall onto the floor. They had a wide variety for menu options but my friend and I went with the prefix. I had the beets with yogurt, ricotta and farm egg raviolo with the salted caramel sundae. My friend had the soup, roasted hake and the almond cake. Before our meal, they had given us 3 slices of artisanal bread (I hope I'm not wrong?) with a dish of olive oil. The olive oil taste was very present so it enhanced how I felt about the bread. Then came our appetizers - my friend's soup was good but I only had one spoonful so I cannot comment well. My beets were sweet and juicy(I'm not sure if I have the right word here...) that paired well with the tartness of the yogurt. Next came our entrees and from the bite of hake I had, it had no hints of fishiness and it tasted good. My entree of raviolo had a LOT of cheese on top. When I took a look at the other photos, they had less parmesan on top. My raviolo had enough parmesan to cover the plate! When I bit into it with the pork ragu, it was delicious. My favorite was my dessert of salted caramel ice cream sundae. It was very reminiscent of cracker jack's popcorn. Normally, I'm not a fan of popcorn but when it's made like this, it's heavenly. The salted caramel ice cream with fudge wasn't overly sweet. The peanuts ----- ahh, I miss this dessert already!I cannot wait to come back to try their pizza though. And their veal meatballs! This is a definite place that I'll come back to visit."
Jade F.,"Salt Lake City, Salt Lake City, UT",3/24/2015,4 star rating,"I came here for lunch.  It's like the Anthropologie of restaurants.  The atmosphere is so classy, elegant, and still cute.  I always bring my family and friends here when they come to visit.I did the grand prix option which I am all for. The butternut squash soup was delicious!  The dessert, salted carmel Sunday (candied peanuts and popcorn, whipped cream, and chocolate sauce) was amazing.  I have been there three times now, and it is the only dessert I have tasted because I just can't skip it now that I've tasted it! (Next time i'm determined to try something else)I will say I wasn't impressed with the actual main course - but I think if I would have veered away from the set grand prix options, I would have been happier as far as the main course goes.  So, if you have the money (which I don't) I would order off the grand prix and just order what sounds the best!"
Agnes L.,"Los Angeles, CA",3/22/2016,4 star rating,Good ambiance. Crab toast is good and filling. We had a turkey sandwich and a burger for brunch. Very generous serving. A hip place for brunch and on pricy side.
Susan L.,"Manhattan, NY",12/24/2017,4 star rating,"The eggs benedict with flying pigs farm ham and crab toasts both taste delicious. The eggs benedict were cooked perfectly. However, I prefer the crab toasts more. Overall, the brunch is pretty good and I would definitely be going back again."
Tracy W.,"Theater District, Manhattan, NY",2/3/2016,5 star rating,"One of my new favorite restaurants! Scored a high top table for Monday lunch, just in time for restaurant week.  I've been to a few Jean George restaurants and this was one of the best.  They truly do have fresh and local ingredients.  Here's what my friend and I got the following for lunch:Appetizer: tuna sashimi and the lentil soupLunch: crispy shrimp salad and raviolo with pork raguDessert: almond cake with poached pear & green apple sorbet, salted caramel ice cream sundae with caramel popcorn and chocolate sauceHighlights:  The tuna sashimi was superb, very fresh!  The raviolo was delicious!  The egg yolk inside with the ricotta was perfectly made.  The pork ragu was a great pairing.  After a bit, it tasted a little salty and heavy.  We shared so having the salad was a good balance. The dessert was the cherry on top of a very good meal!  I loved the almond cake the most.  It was moist and scrumptious!The service was very very good too!  My water glass was never empty and the food came promptly dish after dish.  I was curious about the 'grain salad' blend and asked one waitress.  She didn't know but another waiter came by to tell me, which I really appreciated.  They gladly welcomed any feedback that I had too because some of the dishes were new.Will definitely come here again!"
Cindy Y.,"New York, NY",3/1/2015,4 star rating,"A group of us (4) came for brunch without reservation. There was a hour wait from the time we arrived (1pm). We were seated in the dining room and waited promptly. The brunch was vegetarian friendly. I had the veggie burger which was served in a pita bread with a small carrot salad and friends had eggs Benedict and pancakes. They were all fresh and locally grown ingredients were used. The food quality was great, however, it was not amazing, not memorable at all. The service was great, the ambience was nice. It's a great place to get together with friends but can't say the food is as good as the decor of the restaurant. I would return for the overall feeling/concept of this place but not because the food was excellent.Note: I have been here several times for brunch and dinner. I would rate it the same each time."
Emily C.,"Mill Valley, CA",10/1/2015,4 star rating,"My friend who lives in NYC loves this restaurant so I made a point of eating here on my recent visit to NYC. Coming from the San Francisco area I was curious to see the NYC interpretation of farm-to-table. Overall the food was excellent as the spices and flavors were inventive.The amuse bouche was a bowl with two tiny radishes. I had the line caught tuna sashimi marinated with ginger and mint which was light and flavorful. My Mother had the roast carrot and avocado salad, crunchy seeds, sour cream and citrus. It was so nice that she's hoping to copy the menu at home. For the entree, I had the pan seared skuna bay salmon, silky new onion vinaigrette, sugar snap peas and herbs. The salmon was perfectly cooked by the sauce was heavy and bland and didn't work with the dish. My Mom had the roasted halibut, crushed tomatoes, market squash and basil and it was the better dish of the two. Fore dessert we split the sundae with salted caramel ice cream, candied peanuts & popcorn, whipped cream, chocolate sauce. It was as good as everyone says!! They had a decent  selection of wine by the glass, but it would have been nice if they offered more that were under $18/glass. I'd go back again and would love to try their brunch."
Luke C.,"Brooklyn, NY",2/10/2017,5 star rating,ABC kitchen was amazing!! Beautiful atmosphere. Delicious food. Great service. Saw Luke Wilson here. He was sitting a few tables down from me. Came here with a couple friends for a trendy dinner on a Thursday night. Very satisfied and will be coming back here again.
Caitlin M.,"Exton, PA",2/28/2019,4 star rating,"I was out by myself and had reservations here at 9 at night. Came in and they took me to this weird little table in the back with comfy chairs that put you down slightly too low. I ordered the market fresh radishes with seasoned butter which were good, the butters were pretty tasty. I then ordered the roast carrot and avocado salad. This was amazing and had a creamy taste with a tang to it! Following that I had the winter squash campanelle, which was good if a little overly sweet from the squash. I had some sea salt to it and that lessened the sweetness. For dessert I had the cookie plate, which was just ok."
Gabi M.,"Phoenix, AZ",11/11/2014,5 star rating,"It's been a couple of weeks since my lunch date at ABC Kitchen, but I'm still smiling as I think about the experience.It was a Friday afternoon, and we had a breakfast that morning that was nothing special.  I hate that... a somewhat wasted meal in a city that has so many incredible restaurants!  So, we decided we needed to treat ourselves to a more memorable lunch... and my husband chose ABC Kitchen.Of course we didn't think to make a reservation, so we had to wait awhile for a table, but it was definitely worth the wait.  We loved the atmosphere here, the service was super friendly, and the food was phenomenal.I had a wonderful lemonade drink to start... all of the real drinks that I saw served during our wait looked fabulous as well.  I don't think you can order wrong here!As for food, we shared the crab toast with aioli and the roast carrot and avocado salad to start.  Both were large portions and the ingredients were fresh, flavorful, crisp, and delicious.  It all worked well together!Next up, I had a crispy shrimp salad and Jared had the lobster entree... Again, we were both super pleased.  As were all of the people around us -- especially the girls sitting super close that were chowing down in the burger and fries.We didn't go for dessert even though all of the options sounded amazing.Next time in NYC, I'll definitely be back for more.  You can't go wrong at ABC Kitchen, but I definitely recommend a reservation if you plan on going...  Enjoy!"
Enoch W.,"Cerritos, CA",6/29/2018,5 star rating,"ABC kitchen is a pricey establishment that offers quality dishes.  I took my girlfriend here for a romantic setting and this place definitely did not disappoint. This place is the definition of mood lighting! I was so dim it was difficult to see the menu, but she loved it :)The cocktails are delicious and well-crafted with very subtle flavors. The main dish that I enjoyed on this particular visit is the black sea bass. The fish was seared perfectly on the top edge adding a delightful crunch to every slice. I also have to give a shout-out to the appetizer that we had. The line caught tuna sashimi marinated with ginger and mint was also incredible! The blend of ginger and mint is perfect over the tuna!"
Mary W.,"Manhattan, NY",4/25/2019,2 star rating,"Came here for brunch and was truly disappointed! Scrambled eggs were not really scrambled eggs, more like egg soup. Very strange, especially for such a highly sought after reservation. Better place for lunch or dinner."

Jasmine X.,"San Francisco, CA",10/31/2014,4 star rating,"Pretty solid brunch option. It's easy to find brunch in NYC, but it's hard to find good brunch that you could see yourself going back to again and again, and I'm happy to say that ABC Kitchen is definitely one of those candidates. My friend and I came right around its opening at 11am and were seated within five minutes. A few other parties who queued before us left saying that the line was too long which was weird since we got seated pretty quickly. Might have been a function of where we got seated--we had an awkward high table near the bar area. Not idea, but given that we didn't make reservations, we weren't surprised. Brunch menu was solid--my friend got the eggs benedict with flying pigs farm ham and I had the kasha and bowtie pasta with veal meatballs. I was super envious of the eggs benedict that my friend had--I definitely wish I had gotten that. Probably some of the best eggs benedict that I had, and a pretty filling serving as well. It comes with a large helping of potatoes. My pasta dish was also pretty good, the bowtie pasta was really interesting--not the type of bowtie pasta that you're thinking. Judging by its shape, I'd guess that they're handmade maybe? It was good, but the flavor of the sauce was a little strong for me. So even though it was good, I wasn't able to finish it.They have a pretty good dessert menu, but we were both stuffed and ended up not getting anything. It's definitely on the pricier side--I think we each paid about $30 for our meal. tldr; pricy, but pretty good. I could see myself coming back in the future. Not necessarily outstanding, but it's a solid brunch option"
Lynn C.,"Weehawken, NJ",4/25/2018,5 star rating,Had dinner on a Friday evening. Great experience overall. The crab toast was really good! The two fish entrees were fresh and the chocolate cream brûlée was good as well. Nice ambience and service. Highly recommend!
Thomas G.,"Vero Beach, FL",8/17/2017,5 star rating,"We were in town for one night, and were window shopping late in the afternoon in ABC Carpet, one of our favorite stores, when my wife remembered hearing that this fabulous restaurant was here.  Naturally, we didn't have a reservation.  But we stopped in at opening time (we are early diners anyway) and they actually had a table for us.The food, of course, was spectacular.  How could it not be. But the best part of our dining was the staff.  Our server was Ashley C, and she made the evening perfect. We told her what we wanted in a wine, and she suggested the perfect glasses.  And then her description of each menu item we were considering was like listening to the chef himself telling us what he was going to prepare for us.  Bravo Ashley!The rest of the staff was equally professional, but I don't have their names!"
Brenda A.,"Santa Clara, CA",8/6/2015,4 star rating,"High-quality ingredients, creative flavor profiles, everything thoughtfully sourced and perfectly cooked - the food here is quite good. The atmosphere and decor is lovely. This would make a great date lunch spot.  Think small plates to share.We had the charcuterie plate for an app, which came with a trio of raw cow's milk cheeses, grain mustard, and honey. My husband had the snapper, which he enjoyed, and I tried the house-made sausage special. Our daughter shared everything we had. Although the staff seemed apprehensive that we had a child with us, they warmed up to her and brought her some crayons. I got the impression that the staff expects children to misbehave, which is at best an unfortunate assumption and at worst a self-fulfilling prophecy.If you're near Union Square Park and are looking for a more upscale lunch experience, I would definitely recommend giving ABC Kitchen a try. Looking forward to trying their second location focusing on Spanish tapas."
Hue L.,"New York, NY",1/8/2016,5 star rating,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in all of NYC.  Decor- Absolutely stunning.  I love the low lighting but also the wooden tables and color preference.  Perfect date night with my bf.  A few tables over I saw a large family having dinner around a large table as well.  Family and Date night oriented.  Absolutely fell in love from the moment I stepped inside.Food - We had the calamari, the mushroom pizza (my boyfriend doesn't even like mushrooms but he loved this pizza), we also got the chicken (most amazing lightly fried chicken I've ever had, it was so damn good), and we also got the fish.  AMAZING.  Service- impeccable.  One of those places that just gets it.  The waitress we had was very accommodating and made sure she had the chef divide the portion because we mentioned that we were going to be sharing.  Great job anticipating without us even asking.We lingered around for a little longer, sipping some wine because this place was just amazing.  Loveeeeeeed it.Would definitely recommend and come back soon!!!"
Maruko S.,"New York, NY",2/20/2018,5 star rating,"Everything we had was really good at ABC, also with the service. We were there for lunch time. And the restaurant still packed. I like the decoration."
Callie R.,"Portland, OR",9/21/2015,4 star rating,"Our group of four ordered a handful of dishes during our brunch at ABC kitchen: biscuits (meh), seasonal gazpacho (excellent), shisito pepper-okra somethings (meh--can't even remember what it was), french toast with peaches (delicious), the vegetarian burger option (my omnivorous father actually really liked it), the Eggs Benedict were well-received. The watermelon cocktail I had with brunch was absolutely divine. Aside from the cocktails and gazpacho, nothing we ordered was necessarily crave-worthy, nor notable enough to come back one the premise of the food alone.The service was attentive and prompt. I could see myself returning with a group of girlfriends to enjoy the atmosphere and some stereotypical brunching, but that could easily be accomplished at other locations as well. I really enjoyed wandering through ABC Market, looking at furniture I don't need and overpriced handmade stick candles."
JUSTINE M.,"Philadelphia, PA",7/14/2015,4 star rating,Great service: I appreciate when the wait staff know the menu to the minute ingredient. Plus our waitress gave very good suggestions to brunch.Decor: Beautiful space. It felt as if we were having brunch in an enchanted dream.Food: Very flavorful and good portions for sharing.
Alex L.,"Poulsbo, WA",4/12/2018,4 star rating,"Fantastic ambiance, great service, even better food. Casual enough to wear jeans with girlfriends and nice enough for a date. I got the hake and it was perfectly cooked with a delicious bean sauce paired with it. The free bread is also super fresh and a nice start to the meal."
John L.,"New York, NY",12/27/2017,5 star rating,"I was meeting a friend for a drink here and had a really nice time. The bartender made our drinks perfectly and Yoki, the manager, was super cool and offered to bring our second round to us despite there being no official wait service in the bar area. Too often employees strictly limit what they will do to what their technical job description says. This is a slippery slope to Postal Service-level treatment. Yoki sets a good example!  Thanks Yoki!!"
Chris C.,"Irvine, CA",3/9/2017,3 star rating,"Crab cake toast: probably our favorite thing of the evening. Mushroom egg pizza: good ingredients. the mushroom flavors were excellent. thin crust was nice and crisp. Sea bass: really good, great texture and flakiness. The top layer was cooked superb.Why 3 stars? Service was lacking for us. Our main server was busy with a large table nearby, so we were neglected to put it nicely. They did send over another server to help her out. He was extremely friendly and nice, but every time our server stopped by it seemed like she didn't want to be there. Diminished what was otherwise a pretty good meal for us. Ambience and decor of the space was really elegant and chic. Probably would come back and give it another shot, but we live in California and this was one of spots we were looking forward to on our trip. We left disappointed unfortunately for us."
Matthew K.,"Hoboken, NJ",3/21/2019,5 star rating,"There was an amazing ambiance entering the restaurant. The dim lighting and interior design was modern and visually appealing; this was expected since this is a restaurant of the renowned ABC Carpet & Home furniture store. The waiters were very attentive, and even though they made a few messed on our table, they provided excellent service. The menu was small, but that's what made the food extremely special. My personal favorite was the Prix-fixe lunch menu: Seared salmon, bibb salad, market vegetables, spicy buttermilk-herb vinaigrette. The salmon was amazing and I would highly recommend getting it medium rare. I was really satisfied with what Michelin Star Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten's ABC kitchen had to offer and I cannot wait to come again!"
Katherine D.,"New York, NY",7/10/2015,5 star rating,"ABC Kitchen continues to be one of my favorite NYC hotspots. With countless options in NYC, it's often hard to choose, but the fresh quality of the ingredients here, coupled with the charming, private decor, and consistency, makes ABC Kitchen a no brainier. Apps: crab toast with lemon aioli: fresh, succulent, flavorful and excellent to share. I've ordered this several times.  Pretzel dusted calamari: TO DIE FOR! The pretzel crumbs transform the calamari by giving it a juicy, SMOKEY, flavor which is unlike any other calamari I've ever had.Roast carrot and avocado salad, crunchy seeds, sour cream and citrus: was nervous about having cooked carrot on a cold salad but it was fabulous; the seasoning perfectly blended with the citrus creating a wonderful mix of flavors Pastas: house made ricotta ravioli, herbs and tomato sauce--homemade pasta is ALWAYS worth getting Dessert: sundae with salted caramel ice cream, candied peanuts and popcorn, whipped cream, chocolate sauce--I was hesitant at first because of the popcorn, but it blended well with the caramel like the chocolate sauce did with the nuts, very rich, so share it!It's a great restaurant to settle down at after a long day of walking around NYC, pre or post movie, catching up with friends, or a date. The intimate atmosphere makes sharing dishes all part of the experience."
Ellen L.,"Beverly Hills, CA",5/15/2019,5 star rating,Fabulous. Bar none the best plant-based food in town!!  And beautiful and cheerful too !  Can't wait to return!
Julie S.,"New York, NY",12/19/2016,5 star rating,Love this place. The hake and fried chicken were out of this world. Same with the crab toast. They brought out a chocolate cupcake for my fiance's birthday. I would highly recommend.
Lee S.,"Weehawken, NJ",8/10/2015,5 star rating,"Fantastic farm-to-table, organic restaurant.  The crab toast, mushroom pizza, and bread were all really good.  If you go, you have to check out the extension / store next door. There's 3 floors of a bunch of pretty cool stuff.Went for brunch, and the total bill (counting tip + tax) was only $47.  Which is pretty damn good for a Jean Georges venue."
Lyndal G.,Australia,7/22/2018,1 star rating,I've eaten here twice previously. First time they were very obliging I was traveling solo and happily sat at the bar to eat. The meal was very nice. Second time I made a reservation a few weeks out before I departed and I arrived and they had doubled booked!! I told them I'd wait in the bar until they found our reservation & table as it was late December & a very busy time.This meal was nice but certainly not raising the bar by any standards. This visit we stood at the entrance & the obnoxious staff didn't even come over to greet us. They most certainly saw us standing there. If I could swear in this review I'd write exactly what I feel your establishment stands for Absolute B.......C.....I love the store & shop there on every visit to NYC. Plenty of amazingly fabulous restaurants in NYC without the attitude.
Jesse E.,"Nashville, TN",10/31/2017,5 star rating,"Elegant, exceptional and exquisite.This restaurant is amazing. I love how inviting the decor and ambiance was, and how kind and helpful all of the staff were. My reservation was accidentally booked an entire day late, they were packed that night, but were kind enough to find a spot for us.They pour their whiskey cocktails with Whistle Pig, which is the best. Mint Julip was on point. We started with Calamari, which was light and with great texture. The Roasted Carrot and Avocado Salad was amazing, maybe my favorite dish. Topped with sprouts, pumpkin seeds and lite sour cream, this was surprisingly delicious, and filling.The Hake was a beautifully prepared, and the Brussels and Squash were the perfect compliment to the already divine fish. Would definitely encourage any and everyone to come again!!"
Jin K.,"New York, NY",1/2/2017,4 star rating,"Nice experience.Crab toast, which everyone raves about, is delicious as expected! Black sea bass dish, and fried chicken were pretty good too. The Creme brûlée wasn't that great, but the apple pie was delightful!The food portions were small, so if you're going hungry, ravenously indulge in the complementary bread and oil before the food is served.The servers and waitress were nice. They made every gesture to keep us happy, which was well-appreciated. Overall, the food wasn't as awe-striking or out-of-this-world to justify 30-40 dollars per dish so minus the one star.Good food, nice staff, but nothing special."
Hannah I.,"New Hope, PA",11/16/2016,5 star rating,I absolutely love this place - Came here a few years ago with my hubby on a get away date. Then came back a few weeks ago while in town for an event. It was me and some girlfriends. The service is just WONDERFUL and the food delish! I love the ambiance of the restaurant as well. My chicken dish was very good and my friends plates were yummy. I would say they use a lot of lemon on some vegetables - However I love lemon so - that is good! Great time for all!
Mandy D.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",5/19/2018,5 star rating,Food here is always fabulous and fresh. Always a good decision.
Deena B.,"Austin, TX",9/6/2015,5 star rating,"I'll add to the rave reviews - this is my all time favourite restaurant in NYC. I've eaten here 5-6 times, and every time I walk away satisfied. The food is just excellent, everything has that farm to table, ethical and sustainable feel, but with Jean Georges at the helm it's also inventive with lots of unique flavour combinations and ingredients. Every time I've been we always order lots of small plates to share, 4-5 between 3 people is plenty of food. My all time favourites are the roast carrot and avocado salad, pizza with the egg (not the official name), crab toast and the salted caramel popcorn sundae (a must order).The interior is just gorgeous - it's attached to ABC Home which is like an upscale Anthropologie, so everything is quirky, pretty and has plenty of character. The plates are all mismatched on purpose, for instance, and the lighting is just so damn flattering. You feel like you're eating in a really really posh friend's gorgeous home. It's not too pricey, either. Last time I went with my mom and friend, and between the three of us we ordered three small plates, a pizza and side of fries. It was about $75 in total, which we all agreed was beyond reasonable for the ambience, quality of ingredients and NYC. I really like the staff too, and their uniforms are so cute - checkered shirts and skinny jeans. The only problem is it can be tough to get a reservation, so I recommend going during an off time (like for a late lunch on Saturday at like 3 pm) or when they open at 5:30 pm as a walk in. It's an unforgettable dining experience, highly highly recommended."
Christine A.,"Hoboken, NJ",9/16/2016,5 star rating,"Finally a Jean Georges restaurant that I enjoyed!  I thought décor was very nice; similar to ABC Cocina - clean lines, almost rustic.  I enjoyed everything we ordered! - Line caught tuna - yum. Nice and bright flavor with the citrus that is added.  Fish seemed very fresh.- Crab toast - really yummy - clean - crab really shines through.  I kind of wish there was some avocado added, but it probably would have covered up the fresh crab taste. - Pretzel-crusted calamari: pretzel taste doesn't really come through, but the pretzel coating really makes it super crispy.  It's served with a chunky marinara and a mustard sauce. - Duck confit - omg that bacon marmalade that comes on top of the duck was devine.  The plate was put together so pretty too. - Fried chicken - upon receiving this dish, I was a little disappointed - it was a boneless piece of chicken on the plate with some greens on top of a mysterious yellow-orange sauce.  I still was unsure after the first few bites, but after a while, I couldn't stop eating it.  It's one of those dishes that make you confused, but in a good way.  I'm not sure why this worked, but it did.  It's like the faint spiciness was clawing at me to keep taking bites. Get it! - Sea salt caramel sundae - this was heaven in a little bowl.  They don't skimp on the ice cream - 3 scoops - so it's big enough to share. Below the ice cream is this rich chocolate syrup and there is a good helping of caramel popcorn and nuts all throughout.  Rich, salty, sweet... yum! Thanks for finally making food that was hot enough and delicious enough!  In my opinion this restaurant takes the cake over ABC Cocina and even Jean Georges. (gasp)."
Christine K.,"New York, NY",11/13/2016,3 star rating,"Maybe I had high expectations, but ABC Kitchen was just mediocre in terms of food. I wasn't too impressed with the crab toast or brussels sprouts. Even if a dish is simple, there should always be a focal point--sauce, char, so on. While the food was not bad, nothing stood out. Given the price, I don't think ABC Kitchen does justice to the ingredients. The ambiance is cute, and I'm sure it's a fine place for sipping on some cocktails and wine, but overall, I don't think I'll be visiting, again..."
Apurva N.,"Manhattan, NY",1/19/2018,4 star rating,"After a long hiatus, I am glad to be back on Yelp!I had a brunch/lunch meeting at ABC Kitchen last week and honestly I was a little surprised that I had not been here before.  The restaurant has a ice ambience that is probably best described as familial - not too quiet, not too loud, fairly friendly and casual, yet somewhat upscale. The hosts were welcoming and while I didn't have a drink at the bar, the bartenders seemed engaging and friendly. My friend and I were seated as soon as we both arrived. Our waitress was quite nice and knowledgeable about the menu as well. We both ordered the Kale Salad and added the grilled Salmon to it. We also got the Brussel Sprouts Pizza to share. Our food arrived fairly soon. The salad was really good and the salmon was cooked perfectly. The stand-out, however, was the pizza. It was VERY good. I was glad we ordered it. Not too cheesy, just the right amounts of everything. Brussel sprouts on a pizza may sound weird at first, but trust me, its a good choice. I highly recommend it.My friend, who has been here several times, told me that the dinner menu is excellent as well. I will be sure to come check it out soon!"
Stephanie V.,"New York, NY",9/18/2015,5 star rating,"I've been waiting a long time to eat here. They say its hard to get a reservation but I think its because they bake a lot of time into when you do make a reservation. I had a time set for 6pm but was 30mins late because of work. I called ahead to let them know I would be late and when I got there they said they I would just have to be out before the the 8pm reservation. I was happily pleased that they cater to your dining experience. So as an avid yelper, I ended up ordering everything based on the highlighted options that yelp recommends. Calamari - average (i'd skip) Crab toast - amazing (get two) Mushroom Farm Egg pizza - soo good (do they do takeout?)Caramel Sundae - yummy but idk if i'd get it again The food was great. The atmostphere is spacious, tasteful, and trendy. The service was attentive (maybe a little too attentive). Can't wait to go back (in a few months when i can get a reservation)"
Misha T.,"San Francisco, CA",7/26/2015,4 star rating,"Get the crab toast. Maybe get two. Maybe three. Depends how many of you there are but you'll want at least half of one per person. Also the carrot salad is incredible. I was skeptical about how good a carrot salad could be but damn. It comes with sprouts, seeds, avocados, and more. They roast the carrots tying the whole thing together.My entree, the veal meatballs with farfelle and kasha was just ok. I liked the texture the crispy kasha added but I probably wouldn't order it again.Byt seriously. Crab toast all day."
Jennifer P.,"Downtown Royal Oak, Detroit, MI",4/16/2017,1 star rating,"Server could not substitute market potatoes for mashed potatoes. I think that's all I need to say.Plus, the portions are microscopic...we almost couldn't see our food. You're paying to sit at a fancy wood table. All six of us were pretty unimpressed."
Allie L.,"New York, NY",3/22/2017,4 star rating,"I had a nice dinner here last night with my mom. Here's a rundown of the experience:- Service: our server was very nice and informative. She checked on us often enough and gave good recommendations.- Atmosphere: casual chic. It's a big, loud restaurant with tables close together.- Drinks: we each had a cocktail and a glass of wine. I had a grapefruit mezcal cocktail and my mom had a ginger margarita (both $16). The ginger margarita was the better of the two but I enjoyed both. We both got a glass of Chardonnay after which was good but pricey ($18). The wine list in general was pretty pricey by the glass. -Food: we had the beet and yogurt salad to start along with the crab toast. We both then had the roast hake. The crab toast was my favorite of all - it had big chunks of crab and had a nice spice. The beet salad was good as well but small. I enjoyed the hake as well but it was a little too spicy (it didn't appear spicy on the menu).-Price: about what you would expect in Manhattan. Would be nice if they had some less expensive wine options.Overall we had a good experience and will be back!"
Mads B.,"Atlanta, GA",7/23/2017,5 star rating,"Worth the hype. The ambience is lovely. The service is friendly. The wine is to notch. The food is memorable. My favorite things we are were the beets and yogurt, tomato bread, mushroom pizza and the chocolate cake. The mushroom pizza goes down as one of the best things I've eaten in recent years. Can't wait to go back!"
Hilary Z.,"Berkeley, CA",1/2/2018,5 star rating,"Had a wonderful new year early dinner here. We were being last minute and decided to give it a try without a reservation. 5:30 p.m. kitchen opens and we were seated by 5:45 with our drinks on hand already. As within part of ABC carpet and home, I am such a fan for ABC kitchen decors, from the chandeliers, brushed steel serveware to echo distressed mirror, which elaborate the whole dinning experience (and they do sell them online). Ambience is warm but quite and easy to speak. Meal was good overall, and I highly recommend their pork confit with smoked bacon marmalade and braised turnips."
B W.,"Arlington, VA",3/11/2019,5 star rating,Great decor...pancakes with lemon sauce for brunch was really good...cheese biscuits needed jam!  Donuts were fresh and tasty...they did a great job on a busy brunch Sunday.
Kimberly L.,"Redwood City, CA",7/24/2010,4 star rating,"Came here for a nice lunch on a Saturday afternoon.  It was a great surprise to know that you can walk inside ABC towards the restaurant through the back.  Although our entire party wasn't there the hostess would not seat us...but one friend was running late so she finally seated us.  To start we ordered  the heirloom tomatoes toast, they were really good but the ends were a bit too burnt for my liking.  I tried the burger with pickled jalapenos!  It was delicious and super juicy.  Probably one of the best burgers in NYC.  The fries on the side were great and there was a wide variety of light lunch choices, I would love to go back for dinner and try more dishes."
Sarah C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",6/21/2018,5 star rating,"I've been wanting to go to ABC Kitchen ever since I moved to New York and was finally able to make a reservation to celebrate my birthday. Let me just say, it was one of the best meals I've ever had! My dad and I split everything, beginning with the Roasted Carrot and Avocado Salad - WOW!! Highly recommend. They even split it for us. We also got the Casarecce pasta with fennel sausage, broccoli rabe, and Shepard's basket cheese - delicious!! Slightly spicy, but so so good. Finally, we ordered the asparagus pizza - an amazing combination! It was the perfect amount of food for us to split. Since we were celebrating my birthday, the waitress surprised me with a chocolate cupcake and plate with 'happy birthday' written so beautifully! Since that didn't seem to be enough, we topped off the night with the sundae dessert! One of the richest desserts I've ever tasted!!  I will say it is pretty dim inside, but it was very intimate and pleasant. We had incredible service and our waitress was so thoughtful to talk through the menu and provide her recommendations. I could not have imagined a better birthday dinner!!"
Edward C.,"Manhattan, NY",2/19/2016,5 star rating,"I was a bit apprehensive of the rustic decor, but the delicious smell emanating from the kitchen overcame all my inhibitions. If you ask how that could be, I give you exhibit A, the fried chicken. It may look unassuming on the menu, but your taste buds will quickly become obsessed with its delicate and flavorful taste. My Grandmother would be amused that they stole her secret recipe. And least I forget, the lobster miso toast is an incredible appetizer. You could potentially order two for a meal, or be well liked by sharing it with your significant other. A gem of a spot that lived up its high praise. And don't forget to get the salted caramel ice cream with a popcorn surprise for desert!"
Paris F.,"Pike Place Market, Seattle, WA",7/6/2015,4 star rating,"What an amazing decor, ambiance, service and the food.  The three hostesses were all friendly and set us up on a good start.  The table location was not where I wished I would be, however, that didn't bother me as much since our waitress was just as friendly as the hostesses.  The akaushi burger medium was perfectly cooked.  It was bit salty, but it was delicious.  The crab toast was my favorite.  It is now one of my favorite brunch spot."
Al L.,"Toronto, Canada",7/23/2015,4 star rating,"Could only get a late...very late reso at 11:30pm on short notice. Not sure why ABC kitchen isn't a bib gourmand, but ABC cocina is. Out of the two, I definitely liked this one more. The carbonara and crab toast were both tasty and delicious. The fish I had was great as well. They knew we were sharing, so they split the portion into two separate bowls instead of bringing it out in one dish, which is a nice touch. Really enjoyed the popcorn sundae as well. Was sweet and had good texture. There was alot of ice cream, so we were actually struggling to finish it. The ambiance/vibe was nice. Basically feel like youre eating inside of ABC carpet...."
Olivia H.,"Palisades Park, NJ",2/28/2015,5 star rating,"I've been DYING to go here. Definitely a rsvp is necessary. The interior design and furniture is obviously from ABC home. So nicely decorated and rustic. Not the high end fancy shamancy. But the food is better than those fancy places. The price is pretty much the same lol. Appetizers:1- crab toast (2nd to best dish.. I don't understand how they get their bread that crispy. Is it deep fried??) 2- roasted beets with homemade yogurt (I love beets ... The yogurt was very potent) 3- roasted carrot and avo salad with sprouts and seeds as the greens ( best salad, I've had in a long time. Not your typical, because of the sprouts they use) Entrees: 1- cheese burger w. Jalapeños ( bf had this and said it tasted healthy and the fries even tasted healthy lol but he didn't need the jalapeños) 2- turkey sandwich with arugula and jalapeños on a pita instead of a roll and swapped out the fries for salad. (Sorry for those ppl who hate people who makes substitutions .. Heh)-- BEST DISH the pita bread was very chewy and the perfect consistency for the turkey and the heat from jalapeños was perfect for meDessert: 1- sorbet : comes with 3 scoops and you can mix and match flavors-- Choco mint, blood orange, and green apple Service: fast & friendly. No complaints Total price was $130 in total with tip."
Msnoitall A.,"Aspen, CO",6/9/2017,5 star rating,This restaurant is not to be missed!! We started with the green pea soup (deeelish!) followed by tomato mozzarella pizza and Casarecce pasta with fennel sausage and broccoli rabe. The simplicity of this dish belies the rich taste of this dish. Finished off with the Creme Brûlée. Great hip vibe. Place was packed on a Saturday night. I will revisit this place for sure on my next trip.
Joe C.,"Midwood, Brooklyn, NY",11/14/2016,5 star rating,"ABC Kitchen is one of the best restaurants in NYC. They offer a wide variety of local, farm to table, organic and non-GMO items on their menu. It's usually very hard to get a reservation and people keep coming to eat even after 11pm. You can not go wrong with anything you order from the menu. Everything is delicious! I highly recommend the mushroom pizza with egg on top. It's awesome. Its small and you could eat it all on your own or you can be nice and share with your company. For dessert you must order the ice cream sundae. The hazelnut ice cream hot fudge Carmel popcorn and peanuts...It's amazing! I recommend coming here for a good meal with friends or date night."
Callie C.,"Washington, DC",7/9/2015,4 star rating,"Went into the ABC home store to check it out when we stumbled upon this restaurant. We ended up eating a late lunch/early dinner because we couldn't pass it up! I started with the roasted carrot and avocado salad and it was UNREAL. One of the best preparations of carrots I've ever heard. I told my family that I think I could eat it every day of my life. The avocado as perfectly ripe and the (pumpkin?) seeds added great texture. It also had watercress (I believe) and THE best croutons I've ever had. They were crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside, while they were also sopping up the amazing dressing (but maintaining their crunch). It was so wonderful I think I'll dram about it tonight.For my dinner, I had the veggie burger. I was not expecting it to be fried, so that was a disappointment. Overall, it didn't have the flavor profile I was looking for. If you really enjoy mint, it would be great slathered in the mint yogurt sauce, but as a non-mint eater I got it on the side. It just didn't do it for me! The rest of my family got pizza. My father got the asparagus and bacon one and basically said it was some of the best pizza he ever had. My mother said the crust was amazing (which means a lot coming from the avid crust lover she is).For dessert, we ordered the carrot cake and salted caramel sundae. The carrot cake was subpar and I would not was calories on it. On the other hand, the sundae was amazing. I was not actually the one to order it because it seemed boring to me. Sundaes, in my opinion, always need something like a cookie or brownie to hold it together. I was happily surprised to find that this sundae was amazing. The caramel popcorn added such a nice crunch and the peanuts at the bottom were a sort of brittle. They also didn't skimp on fudge! The ice cream itself was really delicious and smooth. When you get the perfect bite of peanut brittle, popcorn, fudge, and ice cream, it is just pure happiness in your mouth.The drinks were also really good too! I had the lime basil soda and really enjoyed it. I don't usually like very herby drinks, but the basil was subtle. My family said the wine selection was great, and my mother really enjoyed her rhubarb cocktail.Overall, a great experience at ABC kitchen! We decided we would go back in a heart beat (and you best bet I'm getting that carrot salad). If you've never been, you have to try it!"
Julia H.,"Queens, NY",8/24/2016,2 star rating,"I give 2 stars to the food and the atmosphere, 0 star to the service.My friends and I were surprised how the servers here could be so unprofessional at this highly reviewed restaurant by Jean George.We went for lunch during weekday, and we were sitting at the table for 15 mins without a single waiter/waitress greeting us, finally the waiter decided to come over to our table , but all he did was just threw the menu on the table and left without saying anything. We had to look for a waiter to order  food for us after at least another 15 mins of waiting for someone to serve us. When all our foods came, the waiters just carelessly threw everything on the table without saying a single word and left. was wondering if they were taught not to open their mouths? Lolwe found out all other tables were served with breads during the meal, BUT WE WEREN'T.  we had to ask server the reason of it. Guess what, He didn't apologize nor cared to explain, all he did was just grabbed a basket of bread and threw on our table again. i was speechless up to this point. And the worst is yet to come, We also ordered wine flight which should be included 3 glasses of wine but we only got 2. We had to check with waiter again for it, and yet we got the last glass of wine WITH A BUG IN IT.It was a horrified experience to dine with abc kitchen. Honestly I gotta say the food was ok, but the service is just HORRIBLE."
Mimi K.,"Seattle, WA",5/29/2017,4 star rating,"I went here on a Wednesday night for dinner.  This place was crowded but we were able to wait at the bar and grab some wine.  For our meal, we ordered a few different things to try and nothing disappointed!!The ravioli was amazing and so was the sea bass.  The ingredients used were so fresh and the dishes were simple and full of flavor.  The service was also pretty great.  I can't wait to go back."
Mauricio P.,"Manhattan, NY",5/25/2018,4 star rating,"I love this place, the food is always amazing!!!But...the chairs are sooooo uncomfortable! They are metal and sides are narrow and after 2 hours of digging into my thighs I just wanted to leave!!!"
Suanne L.,"Brooklyn, NY",12/14/2011,4 star rating,"ABC Kitchen - trendy, shabby chic, farm to table freshness with expert execution. When Jon F (OpenTable VIP) got a 9:00 pm reservation, I jumped on the chance to try ABC for the first time (although that may sound terribly late and poor for digestion, it beat the alternative of 10:30 pm!) ABC is a wide open space, with exposed brick, glass, and rugged wood bars. Its beautiful in an industrial meets organic juxtaposition with exceptional service, and an incredibly diverse and ever-changing menu.We ordered:Butternut Squash w/ Parmesan - sweet, sour, crunchy, and nutty - nice portion size.Raw Diver Scallops - out of this world. A crazy flavor combination of sweet,fresh, nutty, and sea.Housemade Spaghetti w/ Chanterelles - Very generously sized entree, with large chanterelles - yet overly salty.Fried Chicken - good crunch, great sauce. Chicken breast only.Sunchokes w/ Hazlenuts - look like bamboo shoots or ginger, but taste like a crunchy sweet potato. Interesting and delicious.Pear Crumble w/ Ginger Ice Cream - comforting, fresh, and just the right balance of sweet, creamy, and crunchy.While the price seems high, quality was fantastic and service amazing. Demand is very high (with many full tables at 10:30 pm) so if you're looking to save cash, pray that ABC gets unpopular fast. With my stellar experience, I doubt it will happen soon! 4.5 stars"
Yasmin A.,"Wilton, CT",12/29/2018,5 star rating,"One of the best dinners I have ever had in NYC!  There's no wonder why this restaurant is always packed.  There were six of us in our party, and we all agreed that the appetizers, entrees, and desserts were all delicious!  I had the Wood Oven Roasted Lobster with Truffles and it was the best lobster I ever tasted!  It was far from ordinary.  I only wish there was more.  We shared several desserts for the table and none were disappointing.  The cookie plate came with a nice variety and was perfect for sharing.  The apple pie with pecan ice cream was amazing!  Even the cappuccino was delicious.  I'd definitely come here for dinner again."
Dmitriy S.,"New York, NY",7/1/2017,4 star rating,"ABC has been in my bookmarks for a while, even though I've been to their sister place, ABC Cocina... Which was awesome by the way.I could see why everyone likes the place and the decor, which is very minimal and clean, but I can't say I fell for the hype food wise. Don't get me wrong, everything was fine, I especially liked the ricotta toast with the strawberry compote, but I can't say I was blown away by anything... Especially for the price point ($250 per couple, with tip)."
Misun K.,"New Brunswick, NJ",3/10/2015,3 star rating,"I came here with some girlfriends for a weekend lunch. There were parts of my meal that I really enjoyed, and other parts that could have been better.I had the roasted portabello with celery leaves as a appetizer. It was grilled perfectly but it was extremely salty, or at least it was salted unevenly. I was actually crunching through salt. Disappointing, since it could have been really delicious.I had the akaushi cheeseburger as my entree and it was cooked perfectly with a mountain of shaved cheese on top. It was good but I don't know if I would order it again. It tasted like something was missing and was a bit one-note.To drink I had the lemon and thyme soda with salted glass rim. It was very good, especially if you are not into sweet and sugary sodas and it pairs pretty well with food.The interior was very nice and it was packed when we went. I wasn't entirely happy with the meal but I would try this restaurant again."
Hyesil C.,"New York, NY",4/20/2017,5 star rating,"I've been here multiple times and it just gets better and better after each visit. Each dinner just reaffirms my love for this restaurant. First things first, the ambience and décor is phenomenal. Perfect date night feel but also good for groups and for any occasion possible. The service is impeccable and just the right amount- not too little where you're looking for them but not too overbearing either. You can tell that management really focuses on training their staff and this is something that is always so important to me. Now onto the more important parts- the FOOD.The famous crab toast- AMAZING and a MUST. I'm not going to lie that it IS pricey for ONE piece of toast just cut up into 4 pieces but its just so darn good that I would order if every single time. That being said, they definitely don't skimp on the crab and it is really packed onto the top of that toast. Crab is also fresh, toast is toasted to perfection and the lemon aioli works so well with the crab.. This appetizer is a win.Roasted carrot avocado salad- another win. The textures of the salad work so harmoniously and the flavors just dance in your mouth. Great dressing that is not too overpowering as well.Mushroom pizza- as a LOVER of mushrooms, this dish just knocked it out of the park. The mushroom flavors just pop out at you.Homemade bowtie pasta with meal meatballs- For my main dish I obviously had to opt for one of their freshly made pasta dishes. Phenomenal as well. The pasta had amazing flavor and the veal meatballs were divine. Definitely try any of their pastas during your visit.Black sea bass- This was my boyfriends dish and he loved it as well. It comes with baby potatoes and spinach. Definitely on the blander side compared to the pasta but still has the simple flavors of chilies and herbs that work with the sea bass.And last but not least for dessert, we got the sundae with salted caramel ice cream and popcorn- one of the BEST desserts I've ever had. We are a sucker for salted caramel anything so we knew we had to order this. The ice cream tasted to freaking yummy and the popcorn and candied peanuts added the perfect crunch to the dessert. Oh its also topped with whipped cream and fudge so you can't really go wrong there....This place is a must go. You gotta be on top of your game for reservations though so good luck!"
Joanna S.,"Manhattan, NY",1/19/2016,5 star rating,"This is a great find, hard to locate as the front doesn't have a large sign so very unassuming when walking up but this place is huge inside. They also have stores in the back with cool decorative objects for your home.The food is brilliant, however deciding on a dish is difficult because everything looks delicious. I chose the ricotta and spinach omelette which comes with potatoes, this was good but not as incredible as the cheddar biscuit appetiser which comes with a homemade cranberry jam which is delicious and we ordered a mushroom and egg flatbread which also went down very well.I'd also recommend getting one of the homemade sodas both the apple and the Brazil are extremely refreshing. Then juices also look greAt but you don't want to fill up on a juice here. Overall a really cool find with incredible food, and not they suck brunch menu which makes a nice change."
Marge P.,"Brookline, MA",9/13/2016,4 star rating,"Went for Sunday brunch. The food is amazing--had the mushroom pizza, beets and yogurt, crab toast, biscuits, and avocado salad and fried calamari. The room is beautiful.  The drawback is the punishing din exacerbated by exposed rafters, no carpeting and cavernous space. There must be some kind of ingenious design savvy way to install some sound soaking material. I can't stand shouting and eating and don't understand how the nearby table of eight around a huge table could talk to each other! That's why I give four stars."
Michelle P.,"New York, NY",1/27/2015,3 star rating,"Yeah, I'm shocked that I'm giving ABC Kitchen a 3 too. I am basing this solely off of the food - which was underwhelming in my opinion. The ambiance is absolutely gorgeous and I love the vintage teacups and saucers and dishes that they serve on - super cute. The service was impeccable. The food - eh. Over hyped in my opinion!We came for brunch and had:1) the crab toast with lemon aioli (this was my favorite; flavorful and fresh);2) the ravioli (ricotta is made in house; comes in a tomato sauce; just really bland; you can get a small portion 4 or large portion - 8); 3) the mushroom and farm egg pizza (again, bland)4) scrambled eggs and crispy oysters (this was great!; I didn't get the egg accompanying it, but still good)5) buttermilk and cheddar biscuits (these were fine)I expected more flavor from Jean-Georges. But, overall, it was just okay. I'm not dying to come back, but I would if a friend wanted to for a birthday party or special occasion."

I also ordered crab toast! it tasts good too, not as good as the pizza! its better when u squeeze lemon on it!Last but not least, i ordered Salted caramel sundae for dessert! i love the combination of popcorn w ice cream! it just goes well together!This place is good for date or celebrations!!"
Deb B.,"Oakland, CA",5/8/2017,3 star rating,"I came here because Miranda Kerr named this as her favorite restaurant. LOL. I am not from New York, but when I was planning my trip to NYC, I specially put this restaurant on my itinerary, because I really wanted to see what the hype was all about. I ordered the crab toast with lemon aioli ($16), because everyone on Yelp raved about it. And, it did live up to expectations. Thanks fellow yelpers! However, at $16 it is very pricey, and portion size is only good for one. However, I enjoyed it so much, I ordered it again in the same sitting and finished off the second one as quickly as I had done the first. The roast carrot and avocado salad with crunchy seeds, sour cream and citrus ($17) was really bland. Most people, I am sure, are pretty capable of making much tastier salads at home. I mean, if I am going to spend $17 on a small salad, it should at least taste good. This was a huge disappointment. With every bite, I regretted ordering it. I wish had just ordered another crab toast instead. The salted caramel ice cream sundae with candied peanuts and popcorn, whipped cream, and hot fudge ($14) - (another raved about Yelp suggestion) was almost inedible. It was way too sweet, to the point of being gag-worthy. The only reason I forced myself to finish it was because I paid for it. I could not even eat the candied peanuts, because they were stuck to the bottom of the dish, like glue. 5 stars for the crab toast. If I lived in New York, I would probably return at least once a month just for the crab toast. However, the restaurant as a whole did not live up to expectations....the other dishes would be 1 stars. However, due to the amazing crab toast, I will settle for a grand total of 3 stars."
Kirs P.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",8/25/2014,5 star rating,"This past week I pretended I was a lady-who-lunches during a semi-independent (boyfriend was there working, I tagged along to explore, mostly by my lonesome) mini vacation to New York. My favorite lunch, by far, was my dining-alone experience at ABC Kitchen. I had no expectations coming in as I'd not been trying to go here- I just happened to wander by whilst exploring the Flatiron area and decided it looked like a place I might like. I arrived just a little after noon and was greeted warmly by the front of the house staff. I opted to sit at the bar like I usually do for my dining-alone adventures. The bartender was equally nice and was quick to bring over water and the menu.I opted for the prix fixe lunch. First course was the tuna sashimi. It was gorgeous. And delicious.Second course, I had the ricotta & egg raviolo over pork ragu. This was so awesome looking/smelling that the woman sitting near me at the bar leaned over to ask what it was because she wanted it. It was so, so good- but I'm inclined to think anything with a perfectly runny egg stuffed inside cheesy goodness is perfection on a plate.Finally, dessert, a tart with lemon and blueberries. On an adorable grandmotherly china plate. A pleasantly light/not too sweet end to a really lovely lunch."
Haley S.,"San Diego, CA",2/12/2017,5 star rating,"This is a great place for a date or to have a few cocktails with friends. I don't think you could go wrong with any dish. We had the kale salad, tuna tar tar and a goat cheese pizza. Every dish was amazing. The bar area was packed. Luckily we had a reservation (which I thing is necessary if you want to come here). The staff was friendly and attentive even though it was packed. The decor inside was really cool. It's a dark intimate setting so if you have problems with reading make sure you bring your glasses and perhaps use your iPhone light."
Lily M.,"Dallas, TX",11/5/2014,4 star rating,"I made a reservation one month in advance to make sure I would be able to get the time that I needed for brunch on a Saturday.  I'm so glad I made a reservation because I'm not sure how long the wait time would have been seeing all of the people inside on the waitlist.ABC Kitchen is breathtaking!  I'm not even sure where to begin when it comes to the interior design of this place.  The quaint chandeliers, the countryside white furniture, the rustic china, the wooded tables, etc. all contributed to the beauty of the restaurant.The background music was cool.  The service was outstanding, and that's not an understatement.  I felt appreciated to be dining at such a popular restaurant, which is not easy to come by.The brunch/lunch menu had so many appealing sounding things, which made it kind of hard to decide what to order.  We started off with Nonfat Cappuccinos, which were deliciously creamy and toasty.We started off with the Crab Toast appetizer and it was amazing.  The crab was so light and fresh.  It had a slightly buttery texture to it, but it paired so well on the toast.  I highly recommend it!I ordered the Buttermilk Pancakes for my entrée.  Unfortunately, they came out full of powdered sugar, so I reluctantly had to send them back for more pancakes without the sugar, which the waitress happily did for me.  The next set of 3 pancakes that came out didn't wow me.  They weren't fluffy and really didn't have any zest to them.  They were thin and almost had a salty flavor to them.  They also weren't very filling.My bf ordered the Smoked Salmon and it was wonderful.  The smoked salmon had so much great flavor.  The creamy sauce and dill also added to that delightful flavor.  I, however, wouldn't have wanted this as an entrée since there wasn't anything to go along with it, like bread or veggies.I would definitely come back again to try some of the other good looking items on the menu!"
Mahima D.,"New York, NY",11/14/2016,4 star rating,"Spontaneously decided to try out this place for brunch on a Saturday after hearing great things and got there around 1pm with a friend and with no reservations. The hostess told us it would be a 1 - 1.5 hour wait and there was open seating at the bar. We put our names down and thought we would try our luck at the bar. Other patrons were surprisingly aggressive about grabbing seats at the bar as soon as people finished their meals. After about 30 min, we managed to snag two seats and the hostess told us we could order our coffees at the bar and she would move us to the table when our name came up. We were finally seated around 2pm (so her estimate of 1 hour was accurate). Our server was super friendly when he seated us and took our order. He introduced himself, explained the dishes in detail, even telling us his personal opinions on the diffrent dishes and and even gave us some more info about their neighboring ABC Cocina. However from then until the check came he inexplicably disappeared and another waiter brought us our food. We had to flag servers down multiple times for water and no-one really checked on us during the meal. We ordered the mushroom, ricotta and farm fresh egg pizza which was phenomenal! Highly recommend. We also tried the cheddar biscuits which were fantastic!!! Definitely get these. Unfortunately we were disappointed with the scrambled eggs and fried oysters dish - the portion was small for the price and while the scrambled eggs were good the oysters tasted a bit off. Other highlights are that after our long wait, we were seated in these plush armchairs with a low glass-topped table to eat at and the decoration inside was gorgeous. I'm glad I finally got to try this place and believe they have a vegan restaurant opening soon next door - ABC V which I hope to try out. It ended up being approx $40 per person after tax/ tip which was to be expected."
Hitomi M.,"New York, NY",11/1/2017,4 star rating,"I went for Halloween dinner. restaurant was nearly full, but I was able to sit smoothly because I had made a reservation. The food was not bad. But I waited a long time until Entrees came out. The server responsible for my table was a nice person."
Whitney S.,"Columbus, OH",6/13/2017,5 star rating,"So many places to dine in NYC and yet my partner and I dine here every time we're in the city. Brunch is our fave, very relaxed. Crab toast, smoked salmon, raw fluke, pizza, pasta, sandwiches.. it's all delicious! Mint chocolate sorbet is incredible and light."
Sargam M.,"Manhattan, NY",5/13/2015,4 star rating,"Review is for brunch:First of all the ambiance of the restaurant is great - tables set very far apart (compared to new york standards :) ), chandeliers above the tables, market-ish decor of the dining area, and fresh flowers at the bar.Food was good, not great. The pancake with lemon butter, and the fresh pressed juices are worth a special mention though. All in all - a great place to catch up with friends as its not too loud!"
Vanessa M.,"Los Angeles, CA",7/19/2014,4 star rating,"4 1/2 stars.Initially had dinner reservations here but my gf preferred lunch since it was right next to her school so came here on her lunch break around 2 and it was packed! With no reservations and the wait being about 40 min long, we were lucky that the bar area was available. The inside is real nice and big. Very glam rustic. Unique and great indoor decor and well as design I loved the restaurant. The bar area was nestled in the back that seated about 6 so it was perfect since we were in a bit of a rush since her lunch was within an hr. A great restaurant for a date, dinner with the girls or for any occasion, business attire or dressy casual. Service was a bit slow and not the friendliest but it was busy. We did not order much since we were still pretty full from our late breakfast. _Line caught tuna sashimi marinated with ginger and mint ($16). Portion was pretty small. We ordered this twice because it was that good and refreshing. The ginger added a nice kick while the mint made it taste fresh and light. The first order came in 4 but the second came with 6 so it would be nice to know that we paid $16 for 6 and not 4. _Kasha and bowtie pasta, veal meatballs ($16 | $24). $16 for a small appetizer portion and $24 for an entree portion. We got the entree size and shared it. It was pretty big. The bowtie pasta was different from your average american style bowtie. A bit smaller and thin. I wish the texture of pasta was more al dente. The veal meatballs were cooked great and generous portion of meat. Not sure what the crunch was but I liked the texture of it since the pasta and meatballs were both on the soft side. The cheese and herb garnish added a nice touch to the dish. The dish was a bit on the sweet side so after a couple bites it got a bit overwhelming. Still great!_Chocolate cake with malted chocolate ganache, toasted marshmallow icing ($11). Possible one of the best chocolate cakes I've had! Nice big slice of chocolate cake. The cake was so moist and so light. The ganache made it taste rich but not heavy or overpowering. The marshmallow icing was fluffy and paired perfect with the cake without being heavy like most icing can be. A must try!A bit on the pricey side but well worth it. Even though we missed out on our dining experience, I'm glad we got to check out their lunch and the amazing chocolate cake! I'm coming for you next time :) Look forward to trying their dinner menu next time!"
Steve P.,"Chicago, IL",10/28/2017,3 star rating,"Okay, this place is really more of a 3.5. It was good but I wasn't overwhelmed and I didn't entirely get all the hype. The atmosphere is cool and the service was awesome. The server was incredibly helpful with giving recommendations. We got the squash toast which was a seasonal item. I thought that it was good and all of the flavors on it went together nicely. The mushroom pizza was good as well but fairly simple. The angel hair pasta was under he helming - it was somewhat dry and lacking in flavor. Overall, I liked ABC kitchen but I didn't LOVE it like I wanted to considering all the hype."
James K.,"El Cerrito, CA",4/10/2011,4 star rating,"I'm always curious to try out places that has hype to see if there's substance to back it up. ABC Kitchen - um, not sure.Calamari - The pretzel ""crust"" was crunchy and had a peppery taste, and I especially enjoyed the mustard dip. It's not exactly elevated a lot from ""regular"" calamari dishes though.Crab toast - This was refreshing and light, and I liked the texture of the toast.Pasta with veal meatballs - The sauce was scrumptious, and I liked how the kasha added a different texture to the dish. The meatballs themselves were fine but not particularly impressive. Apple crumb tart - This was quite delicious. It was not too sweet and the apple flavor was lovely.Chocolate cake - The cake slice also had a crunch element - like pieces of rice krispies or something similar, which I liked. I also loved the marshmallow icing.The food was comforting and tasted yummy, but the prices are not low and nothing wow-ed me. Service was good."
Michelle L.,"New York, NY",6/24/2012,4 star rating,"I'm always up for trying new brunch spots, so when my friend suggested this place for Saturday brunch, I was immediately down!Atmosphere: 5/5 Big open dining space with a good mix of small and large tables, so good for either a 1-on-1 meal or groups. Really loved the decor here... all the tables had jars of fresh flowers!Food: 5/5 for my French toast. On the menu it said ""with apples"" but they happened to be serving it with cherries that day instead, which was fine with me. The toast was definitely different from your typical, sometimes-too-sweet French toast. It came with powdered sugar on top and syrup on the side so you could adjust to your taste accordingly. The cherries, with their slight tartness, complemented it very well.Service: 3/5 A bit on the slow sidePrice: 4/5 Not too bad for brunch. I was a bit blown away by the prices of some of the drinks though - my friend paid $11 for what looked like a glass of blended green vegetables.Overall- Definitely recommend their brunch!"
Nina M.,"Los Angeles, CA",7/6/2018,5 star rating,"Stunning space, very impressive for a date or even a larger group. We ordered the fluke, cucumbers, calamari, fettuccine, pork chop, and chocolate marshmallow cake (they have fancy names that I can't remember at the moment). All of our dishes were wonderful: the fluke sashimi was perfectly prepared and seasoned, the pork chop was tender with a lovely crust, the calamari was one of the best I've had. Everything tasted so fresh and clean ingredients. I'd definitely come back!"
Lisa Y.,"New York, NY",2/25/2017,2 star rating,"Heard a lot of raves about this place and it is always packed!  Went yesterday for lunch and did the a la carte menu.  For $150 with tip I believe you can eat better elsewhere. However, I may have felt differently if I had chosen the $34 prix fix. It is not top of the line and I won't be going back.#1 the crab toast (that everyone raves about) is very so-so.  It seemed to be made up hours before the lunch rush so the bread was a little soggy.  The crab itself tasted like it had been freshly washed from a can.  SKIP IT.#2 the roasted carrot and avocado salad also had been plated earlier and warm temperature (including the carrots) but was unusual and interesting and I would order it again.  The avocado though was so ripe it was liquid in the mouth.  Did not like that at all.#3 Both the entrees the hake and the black cod were nicely prepared.  The crispy cod was resting on a bed of wilted spinach flavored with basil and was very tasty.  We enjoyed the fish but the portions aren't huge and really ordering apps is mandatory to fill up.#4 cookie plate.  5 large cooked arrived and they were all interesting and we enjoyed them.The service was excellent.  It is a huge restaurant but once again the toilets are one for the men and one for the women and one that is for both.  By one I mean one room with one toilet.  So ,expect to spend a goodly amount of time in line for the bathroom.  I found this offensive at these prices."
Tamara B.,"Middlesex, NJ",12/20/2018,5 star rating,"Friend suggested this for a lunch in the area - it had been on my list for years and seemed that lunch was a better option than dinner.  Friend had been many times and suggested we split the squash toast and the turkey sandwich.  GREAT suggestion and with glasses of Sacerre' we jumped into conversation  - wow!  The squash toast was amazing - going to have   to try to recreate for an upcoming brunch - perfect combination of sweet and salty and out of the rut of avocado toast.  Turkey sandwich was perfect as were the fries... So what next? Cookie Plate and coffee.  That homemade Mallomar made the whole lunch... add the peanut butter and jelly cookie, the fig topped sugar cookie and the chocolate chip... so, after five glasses of water, two hours of laughing and the sweetest waitress that was attentive and yet allowed us to chat, we decided to call it a day.  A rather pricey lunch, but worth it for every bite."

Xida Z.,"New York, NY",12/23/2014,4 star rating,"A Beautiful Scene, Just Look Beyond The Brunch MenuWalking in at 11:30 on a Saturday, our wait for a table of four was 40 minutes. Fortunately, the Union Square Holiday market was just a couple blocks away, so we  gleefully wandered around there. As I walked to the table, I was astonished by how beautiful everything was. It wasn't just the furniture, the waiters, and the food, these things a restaurant can control, but even the patrons were too! When it came to the menu, I managed to find a healthy meal that I couldn't make at home for less than $40, but it was a struggle and it didn't come from the brunch menu. In general, brunch fare tends to be too unhealthy, too sugary, or too expensive. Market fruit plate 9 - too expensiveSeasonal glazed doughnuts 10 - too sugaryButtermilk and crawford cheddar biscuits 9 - too unhealthyHousemade yogurt with granola and housemade jam 14 - too expensiveScrambled eggs and crispy potatoes 15 - too unhealthyEggs benedict with flying pigs farm ham 20 - too unhealthySpinach and ricotta omelette 19 - too expensiveButtermilk pancakes with lemon curd 16 - too unhealthyFrench toast with vanilla poached pears 18 - too sugarySmoked salmon with horseradish, creme fraiche and lemon 18 - okScrambled eggs, crispy oysters and hot sauce butter - too unhealthy I looked beyond brunch and found the appetizers interesting, the sandwiches ok, and the pastas appealing, but it was the market table that caught my eye. I got the crab toast with lemon aioli (16) and roasted beets with housemade yogurt (13). - The crab toast was an open faced sandwich with a generous portion of fresh crab. I was glad that the toast maintained it's crunchiness. - The roast beets came in three colors atop tart plain yogurt drizzled with olive oil. So tender were the beets, they slice right through with a butter knife. So fresh was the yogurt, it was as good as the best Chobani in Soho. Beautiful. Bites from friends' dishes did not disappoint either. - The crispy oysters were silky smooth.- The scrambled eggs were melt in your mouth good, but the potatoes were not crispy enoughService was pleasant. 40"
Yoko C.,"Marina del Rey, CA",5/1/2015,4 star rating,"Nothing is bad, maybe a bit over-rated - 3.5 stars (5/1/2015). I only ordered organic fried chicken and a glass of lemonade vodka. Both of them were good. I finished them despite of the big volume. We were moved to a bar counter as the tar was reserved for VIP customers, football players who played at the last super bowl. I personally think everyone shall be treated same as long as the menu is same. The way a staff told us, ""this table is now reserved for VIP clients"" made me wonder if they serve different quality of services depending on differentiate types of clients."
Jaimie W.,"Orange County, CA",4/30/2015,4 star rating,"I would give 5 stars for the cute rustic ambience, but 3.5-4 stars for food.  The ingredients were all super fresh! However I felt like I had something to critique about almost every dish that my friends and I ordered.  Crab toast was great! This was probably the best part of our meal.  The mint sashimi was tasty, but the portion was too small.  The mushroom flatbread/pizza was good, but we felt the egg was way too undercooked;  It was basically almost completely raw, and it made cutting the pizza so difficult especially since the raw egg made the crust soggy.  The seared scallops were good, but there wasn't anything unique about it.  Also, there was nothing too distinct/special about the pretzel crusted calamari....there was not really a difference between this calamari versus the regular fried calamari."
Holly B.,"McClellanville, SC",4/1/2017,4 star rating,"Beautiful space. Magical ambience, lovely staff. Come early and look through the amazing store. Loved the flavors of the food. We started with some really delicious cocktails, a smoky, dry mezcal grapefruit lavender stunner in a highball glass had great mouth appeal, and the ginger margarita was not overly sweet and remained alluring at every sip. Very flavorful rustic whole wheatbread with a complex dipping olive oil, went well with the tasty mixed marinated olives. Kale salad with mint and Serrano, and the shaved fluke with horseradish came out first on smaller salad plates-- my first reaction to the visual presentation was a big Uh-oh. Both plates looked like scrap heaps, one white, one green. However, while the dishes were visually bland, (the fluke was visually unappealing) they proved quite delicious when forked up. The spring pea soup (also with mint) was vibrant and delish with some snappy whole peas in it, and the spinach goat cheese pizza was yummy even on a full stomach because the cheese was magnificent. We also tasted the homemade pasta with mushroom bolognase, which didn't shine at the same level as the other dishes and was overly oiled. The fava greens were simple and tasty. We finished the meal with an excellent double espresso, and had the almond cake with apple sorbet and poached pear. The cake was yummy, but there wasn't enough apple sorbet to ping pong the flavors around as you ate your way thru the cake..there was less than a tablespoon of the gorgeous stuff, on a small pile of candied almonds. I think they may have run out of sorbet as they were plating our dessert and pushed it out of the kitchen hoping we wouldn't notice. ; )  it was too good not to notice! Hahahahah Really wonderful birthday dinner. Top marks for lovely waitstaff, charming ambiance, and great flavors. Large space can be a bit noisy, and visual presentation of some plates could be more appealing."
Suman M.,"Manhattan, NY",5/20/2019,5 star rating,Went here for our wedding anniversary. It's a beautiful restaurant. Service was impeccable. The servers were polite and very helpful. Food was innovative and delicious. The chocolate cake was the highlight of my meal. Would highly recommend.
Faisal S.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",1/19/2019,3 star rating,"We had dinner here, and while the decor and ambiance of this place was great (the main dining hall, not the back room area), and the service was decent, the food was relatively mediocre. ABC Kitchen's been around for a while, which isn't easy to do in the NYC restaurant world, so they're doing something right - but given the price range and neighborhood they operate in, there are better options. We tried the Sea Bass, Fried Chicken for our entrees, and the Tuna Sashimi as an appetizer - again, pretty good, but nothing that blows your hair back."
Funglin W.,"Sunnyvale, CA",11/12/2016,4 star rating,"Probably the most aesthetic restaurant in New York. This restaurant has always been my favorite in terms of decor and vibe. On top of that, it's the restaurant of one of my favorite chef Jean-Georges! Highly recommend the fried chicken as well as the pasta dishes there! This is a must come place because the food is great for the price and the decor is just... unbeatable."
D. L. J.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",10/15/2017,4 star rating,"It's pretty unique for a restaurant to maintain its cachet and cool factor 7 years from opening, even more so one tucked into a home furnishings store.  But there is good reason for ABC Kitchen's continued success - good, straightforward food at reasonable value; lively atmosphere and consistent performance. We had another solid dinner here last weekend. It's upscale, but casual enough that things are relaxed and breezy. Good place to bring friends.Atmosphere- Rustic and eclectic, refurbished loft type of vibe which maintains the downtown cool factor (= those uncomfortable metal chairs).- Relaxed, great for meeting friends or casual date, but still very vibrant and active, it gets quite busy after 8pm-ish.- Not a fan of the back room (which connects with the store and ABC Cocina), you're basically under brighter fluorescent lighting and miss the ambiance of the main dining area. Think it's more often used as a group dining venue. Try to sit in main dining areas.FoodHas always been solid, good flavor combinations and well prepared, if not particularly exciting. Seasonal touches keep the menu refreshed. We enjoyed all of the items ordered on this visit. We sampled:- Housemade Ricotta, Fig Compote, Grilled Bread ($15): Shines in its simplicity, a great way to start.- Roast Carrot and Avocado Salad, Crunchy Seeds, Sour Cream and Citrus ($17): Love the cumin and pumpkin seeds, nicely balanced and a favorite of ours.- Chicory and Roasted Winter Squash Salad, Maple-Lemon Vinaigrette and Goat Cheese ($16): Really enjoyed the maple flavor, evocative of the fall, though it is rather heavy to call a 'salad' with the amount of squash. Would order just one of the two preceding.- Casarecce with Fennel Sausage, Broccoli Rabe and Shepherd's Basket Cheese ($28): Excellent pasta, classic flavors - nothing particularly unique, but well done.- Fig, Prosciutto, Arugula and Chilies Pizza ($20): Similar to the pasta, classic flavors done well - nice crust.- Toasted Almond Creme Brulee, Vanilla Sorbet ($12): Excellent, the almond flavor makes this classic much more interesting.BeverageAppreciate the fact that the wine list contains many options by the bottle that are not exorbitant. It really matches the food and vibe quite well. On this visit we tried the 2014 Francesco Clerico Barbera d'Alba ($56) which was a good pairing with the pasta and pizza once it opened up, though not particularly my favorite of this type. In the past we really enjoyed the Montinore Pinot Noir from Oregon which is also nicely priced at $52.Service- Similar experience as on prior visits: starts off strong, place becomes very busy later into evening, lags start to increase.- Our waitress was very personable, and pleasant to deal with though she became stretched pretty thin."
Jinny L.,"Montreal, Canada",3/1/2019,2 star rating,"The ambience is beautiful but the food was meh and service was not the best. Also got the impression the waiter really wanted us to leave as he kept pushing the check and said if we wanted desert we could have it ""to-go."""
Jessica James G.,"Washington, DC",1/22/2017,5 star rating,"Hands-down the best dining experience I've had in a very long time. Our server, Emily, set the tone for the whole meal-- genuine, comfortable and an absolute delight. I come up the the city a fair amount and so often at nice places you are smothered with pretension. Both Emily and Scotty who guided us through the meal absolutely made the experience. Starter: Crab Toast. A little heavy (so definitely split), but SO tasty. Entrees: Fried Chicken: most interesting tangy/spicy sauce accompanying the chicken. Delicious!! Crispy Pork Belly: incredible. The mashed potatoes that accompanied the meal on the plate added such a delectable comfort. Dessert: SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT. Salted. Caramel. Sundae. I'm not a huge ice cream person but OH my. This was likely the best dessert I've ever had. From the caramel popcorn topping the ice cream, to the creamy ice cream itself, to the fudge and nuts that sit on the bottom of the bowl...just go for it.Oh! And I almost forgot-- I love a good ambiance. The details of each plate, the tiny flowers on the table, the lighting...all was subtly romantic and welcoming. I loved it all. Thank you, ABC Kitchen!"
Alicia C.,"New York, NY",2/17/2017,5 star rating,"I've been here at least 4-5 times, which says a lot because I usually don't repeat restaurants in New York unless I love it. Each time I went to ABC Kitchen, I left the restaurant very happy. I HIGHLY recommend the carrot salad dish and the strawberry ricotta dish. I literally don't like carrots and I order the carrot salad dish every single time--it is that good. Also, the service is great and the atmosphere is just lovely (really cute plates)!"

Emily C.,"Los Angeles, CA",8/29/2016,4 star rating,"Came here last night for a friend's birthday dinner. I've been eyeing this place for a while so I jumped at the opportunity to check it out and splurge on a nice meal. Ambiance: A+ Honestly, my favorite part of this restaurant is the decor and ambiance. I'm biased because I am a huge sucker for white, minimalist chic decor, and when I stepped foot in the door I feel in love with the place. I want to decorate my kitchen and living room a la ABC Kitchen. Service: A- Service was quite good, the waitstaff was accommodating when we asked to switch tables because our original one was awkwardly big for our group. Only downside was they charged us a $5/person fee for cutting the birthday cake we brought with us, boo. For that price I could have bought another cake. Food: AEveryone at my table ordered something different, and each dish was delicious!! I had the kasha and bowtie pasta with veal meatballs, which was very heavy and flavorful -- almost too flavorful because about halfway through I couldn't stomach any more but I finished it anyways because I hate wasting food. I preferred the more subtle flavor of my friends' halibut and lobster entrees. The buttered corn and dandelion greens side dishes were also incredible. I did love the watermelon mimosa and the sundae dessert I ordered though -- salted caramel ice cream with popcorn and hot fudge, yummy!! Overall, a solid pick for special occasions. It's beautiful and delicious, and although your wallet will probably hurt afterwards, well worth the splurge."

We ordered 8 dishes and shared them all - way better way to enjoy all the great options on the menu.

Would definitely go again."

Another fantastic experience in NYC.  I brought three clients to this restaurant on a recommendation from a friend I do some business with.  We dined a bit late around 9:45pm however the restaurant was busy and had a fun atmosphere.  The food = some of the best I have had in NYC.  I had the pork (photo attached) and my clients had various fish and steak options.  The drink menu was also unique however I went with my standard order Old Fashion with bullet rye and it was by far one of the best I have had in years.  For dessert, the carnal sea salt ice cream with Carmel popcorn on top.  It was delicious.  The wait service staff was also on point.  They worked in teams to ensure adequate service and they did a great job.  I'm looking forward to going back to this place when I return to NYC in a couple weeks."
Lucy A.,"New York, NY",4/15/2019,3 star rating,"Disappointed with the service.  We ordered the ricotta and rhubarb compote which didn't come till 30 mins later and was too soft and sweet, the balance was off.  The sea bass dish was very good but note really noteworthy.  I was expecting a memorable NY dining experience but overall did not meet expectations."
Anna G.,"San Francisco, CA",8/4/2019,3 star rating,"I had dinner with a friend on a Saturday night. I was immediately impressed by the rustic-chic decor. It felt like being in someone's grandmother's country home, complete with floral china for the bread plates. I had the ginger margarita and the ricotta ravioli while my friend had the sparkling apricot cocktail, fluke and a side salad of asparagus and shaved fennel. We shared the ricotta with strawberry compote, which was a standout. The grilled bread was an excellent complement and tasted like it came straight out of the oven.  The rest of the food was underwhelming. The ravioli was a basic red sauce ravioli, which was fine except it cost $25. My friend and I both felt that the cocktails were very skimpy. My margarita came in a tiny glass that was 1/3 solid glass at the bottom and filled to the top with ice. I never order two drinks with dinner, but I did this time because two cocktails equated a little more than one drink somewhere else. For dessert, we shared the strawberry shortcake, which was very good.All in all, a fine meal, but for the amount we paid, we could have easily had a really exceptional dinner elsewhere."
Nina H.,"Seattle, WA",4/3/2013,5 star rating,"This place is soooo gorgeous. If I ever get the opportunity to get married in New York, this is exactly where I want to... or I'd like my wedding reception to look like the inside of ABC Kitchen. It's simply perfect and just so beautiful! The ambiance really helped us enjoy our meal because my friends and I were playing catch up and this was the nicest place to do that. I wasn't very hungry so I ordered the roasted carrot and avocado salad that all the Yelpers seemed to rave about. It was really, really good. The carrot had a vinegary taste and the avocados... well i could eat those for days.I had a bite of my friend's kale salad and that was good too! I wasn't a huge fan of the veggie pita burger, but my friends seemed to love it. The pizzas looked very good too, but I was too full to try, but from what I heard, there were definitely no complaints.Love this restaurant mostly because of the decor! It definitely has the classy vibe, but also the casual atmosphere too."
Connie G.,"Jacksonville, FL",3/13/2017,5 star rating,This place rocks!  The decor and ambiance are relaxing and cool. Service is stellar and the food is amazing. I had the ricotta ravioli and a side of Brussels sprouts.  Couldn't be beat. Make sure to make time to try ABC kitchen out. I plane to go to their sister restaurant ABC Cocina next.
Mr. J.,"Dallas, TX",9/9/2016,4 star rating,"This is one of my favorite brunch and drink locations. Posh, yet casual ambiance, great drinks and cocktail with tasty food. It can get a bit busy and finding a bar spot is tough at times. Service is friendly and attentive"
Corey B.,"Downtown Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",5/4/2019,5 star rating,"Came here for brunch.  The two appetizers, crab toast and calamari, were very tasty.  The entree of scrambled eggs with crispy oysters was good.  The french toast with strawberries was very good.  The lime ginger soda was good.  The chocolate cake with marshmallows was good.  The caramel ice cream with popcorn was delicious."
Joanne C.,"Xinyi District, Taiwan",2/22/2017,5 star rating,"Rustic but modern, delicate but simple. You can feel all the vibe from interior design to food. Love the ideal of farm to table and happy to hear that when waiter took order for us. Food is delicious without no question. Will come back order and try dinner and brunch!"
Rotel G.,"Queens, New York, NY",7/26/2017,5 star rating,"Excellent food, actually amazing!The mushroom egg pizza is the best pizza I've ever hadThe salmon was incredible!

Trinh T.,"Irving, TX",4/28/2014,5 star rating,"ABC Kitchen is an American restaurant in NYC that sports a modern, fresh, and inventive menu.  With so many great restaurants in NYC, ABC Kitchen stood out for me as a perfect combination of an outstanding menu coupled with a great atmosphere.  It also helps that it's one of Jean George's restaurant.My Overall Rating - 5 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)Atmosphere - What I love about NYC is that most places don't have much of a restaurant ""front"" - unless you're in Times Square.  ABC Kitchen essentially has a pair of white doors as an entry, and if you didn't know that you'll miss it.  Once you open the door you enter a beautiful restaurant.  Up front is a bar and waiting area.  There is wood everywhere - white tables & chairs.  It has an elegant, rustic charm.  You know if this much attention is placed on the interior, the menu will match it.  1 Star.Service - Superb.  We seemed to have multiple servers, and our main server was very friendly and helped with menu recommendations.  Also, we were not rushed, even though they were getting busy.  They didn't press us to just get our orders in, instead they wanted to make sure were getting what we wanted.  They even split their famous carrot/cucumber salad for us, cleared the table after each course, etc.  Fine dining with even better service.  1 Star.Food - The menu is so fresh and unique.  The carrot & cucumber salad is the BEST salad I'd ever eaten.  The carrot is marinated and cooked, and has the texture of a protein in a salad - tender and hearty even.  Also amazing was their crab toast.  The crab tasted so fresh, but the star was the toast, which had held the crab for the initial crunch bite, and then softened as you enjoyed your bite.  My main course was a ravioli in a pork ragu.  The ravioli (single) was amazing because inside it was an egg!  Breaking into the ravioli was like breaking into a sunny side up egg.  I've never seen or eating pasta with this technique.  Desert was the caramel ice cream sundae, which was served over chocolate & caramel popcorn.  I was so full, but I still devoured the dessert.  One last note, their fresh cocktails (nonalcoholic) are as good as the food.  I had a cucumber line soda that was so fresh & delicious I would buy a case if they bottled it.  From start to finish the meal was flawless.  2 Stars.Will I Return? - Yes.  ABC Kitchen not only has a seasonal menu, but it's a menu where you want to order everything.  My next trip to NYC will no doubt include a trip back.  I can't wait to see what's next on the menu.  1 Star.My Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. Each Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score."
Grayson T.,"Brooklyn, NY",9/24/2016,5 star rating,"Beautiful restaurant! Very romantic, nice and quiet. Good for special occasions. The waiters were a gentlemen, very attentive! They always come to check up on us.I had pizza, fried calamari, and ice cream here.The calamari was amazing, I loved it. I get to choose 3 flavors for the ice cream and all of them have heavy strong taste. I forgot the name, but the white color ice cream which is sour was soooooooo sour, it was inedible. Food is good and the service alone worth 5 stars. I don't think the ice cream deserve any points off from my review even though it wasn't great, just very strong heavy taste."
Rachel L.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",11/4/2017,5 star rating,"Best of the best. Absolutely stunning restaurant and perfect to have a casual or fine dining experience before your shopping time at ABC Carpet and Home. Can't wait for my Buddha jewelry to arrive and my table!!! Anyway, the restaurant, they are team players, finely tuned staff and farm-to-table seasonal ingredients. Their chefs are encouraging their cooks and the communication between the staff and kitchen throughout the restaurant is top-of-the-line. The roasted carrot salad is plump roasted carrots covered in herbs and scallops are fresh daily. Keep it up! There's a reason they got the James Beard award for best restaurant in 2011. Well done. All of you"
Kyle B.,"West Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",12/11/2016,4 star rating,"Three friends and I decided to make a reservation here and eat in the dining room instead of the usual bar dining experience we have done in the past. It proved to be a good choice. The ambiance is nice and relaxing, not too stuffy like some Jean-George's restaurants. Service was somewhat slow, but good overall. We started with the pretzel dusted calamari, bay scallops special, crab toast and the roast carrot and avocado salad. We loved all the apps, but the bay scallops and roast carrot and avocado salad were standouts. For our entrees, we ordered the black bass, the hake, the crispy pork confit and the kasha and bowtie pasta with veal meatballs. All the entrees were great, with the exception of the kasha and bowtie pasta with veal meatballs. There was some flavor that overwhelmed the dish (it was sagey and piney) and simply threw off he balance. The crispy pork confit is a must!!For dessert, we had the warm apple pie, seasonal doughnuts and almond creme brûlée. The warm apple pie and creme brûlée were phenomenal. They both were comforting and balanced - just the right amount of sweet. The seasonal doughnuts were decent, but didn't necessarily excite any of us (and I love doughnuts, but perhaps these were just a little too ""elevated""?). They also brought the chocolate cake pops on the house and those were very tasty! Overall a great experience. The service could've been a little more attentive for a restaurant like this with so much help. But we loved the experience in the dining room. The bar is also great."
Fanm C.,"Manhattan, NY",4/29/2019,5 star rating,"ABC Kitchen is one of my favorite restaurants!!! I Everything was perfect- from my meal to the water I was drinking. My Server Ty M. was welcoming and very attentive. The food & deserts are so DELICIOUS there, I cannot wait to come back."
Erin E.,"Riverhead, NY",7/26/2019,5 star rating,"Stopped by the bar for dinner and drinks after work last night.  They were very busy, but I received incredible service.  From the hosts, to the bartenders, to the barista who was really sweet when she delivered my double espresso at the end of the meal--I had a great time.  My bartender, Tom, was so great.  Super knowledgable and friendly.   He answered all of my questions and made some recommendations.  I tried their housemade ricotta cheese and strawberry compote with toast as an appetizer (this paired perfectly with the lovely Sancerre I was drinking), their crab toast as a mid course, and had a small bowl of their campanelle pasta as a main.  Each had incredible flavor combinations that were simple and satisfying; the pasta was by far my favorite, though.  Very summery and bright."
Tyler A.,"Queens, NY",7/25/2019,1 star rating,Made a reservation and still had to wait 30 minutes for a table. Switched waiters halfway through and we're never attended to. Charged us for an $90 bottle of wine we never bought but luckily caught before paying. Unprofessional management for such a highly rated restaurant. Disappointing...
Jeffrey E.,"Lahaina, HI",10/11/2018,1 star rating,"Having to wait 4 weeks for a reservation and then the place looked half empty reminded me of my clubbing experience in Manhattan when they have long lines outside and you go into the club and it's empty!For $190 (including tip). This was a horrible experience. From the moment I sat down and was served Luke warm water, it started downhill. I'm an older guy & a few different people came by and I understood very little because it sounded like whispers. I let my son do the ordering & most of what we ordered was recommended by the waiter. The fried calimari appetizer was very small in size and not heated up well. The beat soup had unidentifiable spices that my wife and I thought was disgusted with out the sweetnesses of beats. My wife and son had the sea bass which was supposedly a specialty of the house and tasted very ordinary. I had Monk fish consisting of 2 tiny pieces finished with 4 very small bites and was not worth $190. The inside of the place was attractive. Later, We didn't feel great as well as the next day and we don't believe that the food was organic like it was advertised!"
Lilia S.,"Linden, NJ",4/12/2017,4 star rating,"I was kind of disappointed with this place. But let me first tell you why I will come back here anyway . It's a beautiful restaurant with a romantic atmosphere. The lights and the whole design were phenomenal. Delicious Chardonnay, crab toast, and calamari. But when it comes to the entrees. Sea bass was tasteless, my cheeseburger was just burned. I reported that to this super nice waiter who gave us the free dessert instead but still I was more disappointed with the fact that I was waiting 30minutes for burned food in the restaurant where I made a reservation a month before. Coming back to desserts. Salted caramel icea cream sundae is a must. But I will come back definitely to this place just to try some pizza and different appetizers, not the entrees anymore"
Sharon K.,"Hicksville, NY",4/9/2018,5 star rating,"Couldn't get an reservation via OpenTable. Decided to try our luck showing up and seeing how long the wait was without a reservation. Talk about being lucky. We were seated within 10 minutes of entering the restaurant!ABC is one of my favorites restaurants.An absolute must for starters is the crab toast. I ordered the salmon in mushroom crust which was superb. A totally different texture of salmon. It is so smooth. You feel like you could take a spreader and spread it on a piece of bread or a cracker. The flavor -- oh! so delicious!My friend ordered the pork confit. She loved it.We shared three scoops of ice cream for dessert.Our waitress was so friendly, helpful and her suggestions were spot-on.My friend is from California. She was duly impressed :-)I will be back!!! :-)"
Kate F.,"Philadelphia, PA",6/27/2016,5 star rating,"Every aspect of ABC Kitchen - the food, the service, the decor - is absolutely remarkable. My appetizer of housemade fettuccine with basil-pistachio pesto was by far the best pasta dish I have ever had. The fettuccine was a perfect al dente, the pesto was bursting with flavor, and the grated cheese added a perfect salty note. I will have dreams about this pasta. Regarding entrees, the salmon with a sweet and spicy carrot sauce and roasted carrots was simple yet sophisticated. Though this dish could have benefited from one additional component to make it a more cohesive entree, I did appreciate the quality of the ingredients used. The chocolate cake, which is filled with a malted chocolate ganache and topped with a toasted marshmallow icing, was a great ending to the meal, but the true standout dessert was the sundae with salted caramel ice cream, candied peanuts and popcorn, chocolate sauce, and whipped cream. Our waitress informed us that this is both their most popular dessert and most consistent dessert, as it has been on the menu for six years. I can certainly see why. The ice cream is so soft that it almost has a gelato-like quality, and the salted caramel flavor really shines through. While this sundae can probably feed one devoted individual (example A: myself), it really is the perfect size for sharing. I honestly could not have asked for better service. Our waitress was a true stand-out. Besides demonstrating impressive knowledge of the menu and making valuable recommendations, she took the time to speak to the people at our table about topics not even related to her job (i.e. asking us about our plans for our time in NYC). I want to be friends with this girl hehe. Equally admirable is the interior decor, which simultaneously projects elegance and comfort. I could not stop admiring the white brick walls, beautiful chandeliers, and delicate china, to name a few.Can't wait to return!"
Tyler B.,"Los Angeles, CA",4/8/2015,4 star rating,"Worth it. Every time I come here, I wait forever to be seated and the bill is usually painful to look at, but its worth it.  The food is delicious. Try the Pretzel dusted calamari and crab toast."
Koty W.,"Newark, NJ",11/10/2014,5 star rating,"Getting a reservation at ABC Kitchen is near impossible! They are usually booked up to 6 weeks ahead for decent dinner hours, so I was lucky when my friend called me one night and asked me to go dine with her. What's even better was that it was for her birthday celebration!I got there 45 minutes earlier because I didn't want to be late. Fortunately enough for me, they have a small waiting area with a bar-like table facing the street where you could order drinks while waiting for your table. The waiting area had velvet chairs that caught my eye and a bar right next to it. There was a fair amount of people waiting for tables around 8:45, and we actually didn't get seated until almost 20 minutes after our reservation time. Just shows you how busy they are!We got sat for our table of 4, and something about this restaurant is that all the furnishing is curated by ABC home. Our table was a white desk with white plastic chairs. For larger tables they had a wooden top that resembled a sliced tree trunk. It was also interesting to see that they did not match their utensils. Every time they came to change forks and knives, they would bring a different set of fork and knives.Three of us ordered the Fried Organic Chicken, and the other one ordered.... the akaushi cheeseburger I think (oops). Oh well, seeing as I didn't taste the other dish it doesn't matter so much. Before the entrées came out though we received the Roasted Kabocha Squash Toast on the house. I'm starting to think that Jean-Georges restaurants do this for all their customers, not that it's a bad thing. This surprise appetizer was splendid! I don't eat squash normally, but this was a genius idea! The thick toasted bread gave an opposing texture to the jam like squash. Although it wasn't quite like jam, it was a light topping that paired very well with the apple cider vinegar and cheese. I would definitely order it again next time!As for the fried chicken, it was the best I ever had! My first impression was that this piece of chicken was huge! I was expecting something 1/3 of the size, but they actually brought out at least 12oz worth of chicken in this dish. The crust had a unique design to it, and gave a more elegant crisp compared to KFC. I think that the best part of this dish was the yellow sauce that was underneath the collard greens. According to the website it is hot sauce butter. As simple as that sounds, it did wonders for the fried chicken. You could definitely taste the sweetness at the beginning and the spiciness at the end of each forkfuls of chicken!I should also include that this restaurant claims to offer freshest, organic, and local ingredients possible in all their dishes. The theme of organic and earthy is apparent throughout the restaurant too.Shout out to our first waitress who kept bringing samples of wine for my friend!Compared to Perry St, ABC Kitchen is much more casual and relaxed. The menu items are also cheaper overall and seems to be more American styled with French ideologies. For food I think ABC Kitchen takes the win, and Perry St wins for ambiance."
Kelly S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",9/8/2018,1 star rating,"Overrated! Service was beyond terrible, the server never asked us how our food was, nor did he top up our wine or even pretend to be interested in serving us. I feel like it's somewhere living on a good reputation that no longer holds up! Mushroom pizza was a huge letdown-overkill on the mushrooms, and so greasy! The kale salad was flavourless, I was hoping for some more flavour in the dressing. I've been to many ""farm to table"" restaurants, some nailed it, and some fall short."
Natalie S.,"New York, NY",1/18/2019,5 star rating,"Fabulous spot! Terrific atmosphere, great drinks, and delicious food!"
Lorraine P.,"Scottsdale, AZ",4/18/2014,5 star rating,"I adore ABC Kitchen...this ultra-stylish, farm to table restaurant is so pretty and the food is even better.   The commute to NYC is a bitch though. Jean Georges, will you please bring ABC to LA and be my best friend? Pwease?!To start: Crab toast, Ramp toast, heck... they could put a chicken beak on toast and I bet it would be delicious, just like these 2 beauties. Both had perfect textures atop a piece of crusty bread, fantastic flavor profiles and both left me wanting more.  Another good pick: the Tuna Sashimi with ginger and mint.  So clean and refreshing!Next: Ricotta ravioli.  Unbelievably delicate pasta, a velvety smooth filling and a lovely light tomato sauce. I gave the dishwasher a break and took the liberty of cleaning my own plate.  One of the biggest surprises was the mushroom pizza w/ farm egg.  First off, if you don't like mushrooms, you will probably want to skip over this part, and if you're at a table with someone who orders it, you should step outside.  It's a complete mushroom overload.... like, mushrooms on top of mushrooms giving birth to baby mushrooms. And with a runny egg, it's just WOW. Decadent, earthy mushroom egg-stravaganza. My favorite part? The whole wheat crust.  I'm a whole wheat kinda girl and WW is usually not as good as the white version.  But this crust was so chewy, airy and delicious, I was so happily surprised.They have an exciting drink menu both alcoholic and non, and service is spot-on. While you're there, you'll probably even see a celebrity or two. The dining room set up makes it easy to to eavesdrop on their conversations ;)  Everything is just so impressive and brilliantly styled.  And if you see something you like, well you can buy it for a ridiculous amount of money next door since everything is sourced from the fab ABC Carpet and Home... another store I'd like to have in LA! (I'm all about my ABC's.)"
Alyssa L.,"San Francisco, CA",7/9/2016,4 star rating,"We stayed in NYC for the weekend and picked this spot for brunch on a Friday afternoon. Service was excellent - the wait staff gave great recommendations and came by pretty often to our table. For food we ordered the famous crab toast and carrot salad. The crab toast was a bit too fishy for my taste and the lemons that came with it weren't quite enough to mask it. It was a generous amount of crab though and pretty tasty overall minus the fishiness. The carrot salad, as everyone has said, was delicious - huge chunks of fresh avocado with seasoned roasted carrots. Overall the experience and food were solid and I will be back to try something new!"
Sally L.,"Los Angeles, CA",9/7/2014,4 star rating,"Decor/Atmosphere: 5 starsThe exterior of the restaurant is very misleading, kind of a grungy feel. I walked past it multiple times before realizing this was the place (the sign was also very small). But when I walked inside, I was blown away by the decor and lighting. Not exactly sure how to describe it, but it felt elegant, trendy, and romantic all at once. Must say this was a very pleasant surprise. Recommended for a date spot if you're looking to impress.Food: 3.5 starsMy friend and I shared the following:- crab toast with lemon aioli (the only MUST get item on the menu. probably the best thing here)- heirloom tomato salad with feta, cucumber, and red wine vinaigrette (this might be farm to table, but the $17 salad I got tasted like it came from a 24/7 deli in Times Square.. not from a Jean George's restaurant. Was very disappointed in this, but read the ""Service"" section on how ABC kitchen redeemed itself to me)- fried organic chicken with collard greens and hot sauce butter (very large portion, extremely well cooked and tender chicken, good sauce)- black sea bass (I'd recommend this over the chicken, but portion was slightly small)Service: 5 starsMy waiter was very friendly and accommodating. Everything was going pretty well until they brought up the heirloom tomato salad... It didn't say there were mushrooms on the menu, but there were on my plate... and i have a STRONG aversion to mushrooms (don't ask). Needless to say, I barely touched my plate. My waiter came over and was concerned I didn't like the dish. I explained there were mushrooms even though it didn't say so on the menu, that it was drenched with vinagrette, and was a rather mediocre salad.. He offered to bring out a new one from the kitchen or to simply take it off the bill. Wow! We ended up not having to pay for the salad. I think if we did, I probably would've given this place 3 stars. Thank you to my observant waiter :)Also to note is that they recommend sharing the plates here. My friend and I decided it was a good idea. But we were pleasantly surprised when all the dishes came out in 2's! They had split the apps/entrees in the kitchen so we didn't have to reach over to each other's plates. It's little things like this that make me feel like an appreciated customer.I'd recommend this restaurant to someone purely for the dining experience. I didn't think the food was exceptional (I've had better for the same price), but I'll definitely be looking for a restaurant that comes close to the decor and service at ABC Kitchen."
Tiffany C.,"New York, NY",10/8/2017,5 star rating,"Great service! Food sounds normal but tastes exceptional! Must try the apple ginger soda, very refreshing! Crab on a tiny bread (forgot name) was DELICIOUS!!! Highly recommend it! Ordered the brunch eggs and crispy potato. Eggs cooked perfectly scrambled soft. Potato perfectly crispy outside, but didn't feel potato was special. Portion was small. Friend ordered the burger. THAT WAS PHENOMENAL! Must get the burger! Can taste the charcoal grill and the herb mayo is en pointe. Jalapeño was a great touch to the burger as well! LOVE the decor! Modern, elegant, and classy!"
Carmen S.,"Boston, MA",9/16/2018,4 star rating,"The ambience was beautiful and the service was great the only reason why this place is getting 4 stars is because while the food was good, it wasn't good enough to justify the price. We had the fried chicken and mash potatoes. The mash potatoes were a la carte which is fine and typical at fine dining establishments. They just weren't that great so it was like why aren't these just included? The chicken was  juicy and crispy but again, nothing out of this world. The blueberry pie and ice cream were  delicious. Nothing wrong there. This place is nice, I just know that there are other places that are a bit more affordable and have food that's just as good if not better."
Sherry L.,"San Francisco, CA",1/12/2015,4 star rating,"My second experience was just as great as the first! (Also, is it just me, or are a lot of the servers/hosts ridiculously good looking??) :9Reservations are always recommended, but if you are able to walk in right at opening time, you will be seated in a wink. I've yet to have a dish (appetizer, entree, or dessert) at ABC Kitchen that I haven't thoroughly enjoyed. The daily special is always a safe option if you or your dining companions are particularly indecisive about the menu.  I typically enjoy the fish entrees - the fish is always well-done and typically accompanied by a simple side of dressed veggies or some sort of mash. I haven't ended a meal at ABC Kitchen without an order of the salted caramel ice-cream sundae. It just hasn't happened, and I'm not about to let it happen yet either."
Valerie L.,"Plano, TX",8/4/2014,5 star rating,"I came here for a work lunch and everything was phenomenal - namely, the mushroom, parmesan, oregano, and farm egg pizza ($18).The waiter kept raving about it and I love mushrooms and eggs so I had to give it a shot! The yolk is baked into the pizza. The mushrooms are plentiful. It's chewy, substantial, and flavorful. Definitely recommend this dish.Everything on the menu looked seasonal and amazing, but we ended up ordering calamari, tomato toast, and crab toast to share. The calamari was perfectly tender and the accompanying sauces were delicious.Some people in my group also ordered sorbets and sundaes, and I had a bite of everything. On the expensive, but so, so good.Service was extremely attentive, and the restaurant itself is decorated so beautifully...straight out of an Anthropologie catalogue."
Tom A.,"Warren, NJ",1/31/2018,1 star rating,"Really over-rated. The food is tasty, but the portions are really small and the service is really poor. I'm not a person who expects too much from restaurants except decent service, but for over $100/ person, this was really terrible service. The food was decent, the atmosphere is pretty, but it seems they just rest on that. I would not go back. I would recommend the Clock Tower or a lot of other restaurants."
Sideshow M.,"San Francisco, CA",4/16/2016,1 star rating,"The service is the snobbiest we've seen in NYC. We had a 5:30pm reservation on a Monday evening. We were right on time, and were seated pretty quickly. The restaurant itself is nice, with lots of edison bulbs, flowers on each table etc.Our waiter came by, and we first ordered the roasted carrot salad as we were perusing the rest of the menu. We'd heard good things about the salad and thought it a good place to start. He immediately told us, ""it'd be better if we order everything up front, since it will be much faster that way"". This was what, 5:35pm, and he was already looking to get us out of there ASAP. I guess he figured we didn't look like we belonged there, and so he thought his job was to clear our table ASAP.We still said we'd wait, and first ordered the salad. He dropped by a few times afterwards to check if we'd made up our minds. Finally under pressure, we ordered a half ravioli and the margarita pizza. He told us that the half portion of ravioli would only include 4 pieces, but we were fine with that. Looks like he put in an express order, because the food came in 10 minutes. I think by 6:15 we were done with dinner (and this is with two drinks).I wanted to have a nice dinner with the missus, and given the reviews was excited about the place. Looks like the staff didn't consider us cool enough to be there, and wanted to turn over our table as soon as possible. We had eaten at Eleven Madison Park the day before, and while it was several orders of magnitude better as a restaurant, it was also several orders of magnitude less snobbish.I had a subsequent reservation at Nougatine, which I canceled. I'll never go to any JGV restaurant again. Disappointing such kind of a restaurant still works in NYC."
Stacy L.,"West Orange, NJ",12/10/2019,1 star rating,"I've never written a Yelp review like this before and it's sad that I even have to. A friend and I went here for lunch on a Tuesday. We called beforehand to check the wait time and were told by the person on the phone that they weren't on the floor so couldn't check for us. Not a problem, I understood. Went to the restaurant around 12:15 and it was not super busy, there was no wait time and lots of empty tables. Lots = at least 20. The hostess said she had a really cute table for us with nice chairs and would that be OK with us. Neither of us had been to this location so we said no problem. They sat us at a tiny table right by the kitchen door. I don't even know how plates would have fit on the table. Within 1 minute we asked the waitress nicely if we could be moved because we'd be having a full lunch. She said she would check. While we waited, another waitress came over to us to ""welcome"" us to the restaurant and ask if she could seat us. Obviously we didn't just walk into the back of a restaurant and stand there. We've eaten out before but fine, maybe she was just being helpful. When the original waitress returned she said they could seat us in another dining room but we would have to be done by 1pm. We asked if every empty table was reserved and were told yes it seems that way but she'd have to check again. Meanwhile there were single individuals seated at 4 person tables. We got the message loud and clear and told her we were just going to leave and eat elsewhere. Her response? ""Oh ok! sorry about that"" and just moved on to another table. It was almost as if they were happy we were leaving. One has to wonder whether our skin color had anything to do with this as we were the only people who looked like us in the whole restaurant. Get a clue. This is NYC in 2019. I expected better. I know one restaurant I will no longer be recommending to anyone."
Yvan P.,"Laval, Canada",8/1/2016,5 star rating,"Heard a lot of good things about this place and we weren't disappointed!Got some of the classics you'll read about here: Crab toasts, carrots and avocado salad. We finished with the red snapper course meal to share. Waiter was smart enough to got the plate pre-separated in two portions with sides.  Really liked this place, will be back for sure!"
Alex M.,"Los Angeles, CA",9/30/2017,5 star rating,"One of my favorite lunch spots in all of NYC. Anytime I visit NY from Los Angeles, this is a must go to spot for me and my friends/family."
Mia S.,"New York, NY",1/22/2019,4 star rating,"Freshness. That's how I'd describe the food. The ingredients are very fresh and well sourced. The flavors are very balanced in general. Nothing too overpowering although you might get a strong hint of wasabi in the raw fluke dish - be aware. It's a bit pricy for the portion, similar to abcV but the quality makes it sort of worth it. I liked everything I had, although not necessarily amazed by it. I liked the appetizers and desserts more than the entrees. I also definitely can see the Jean George's influence in flavor, the presentation and the color combination in dishes. I would love to try more dishes from this place next time!"
Catherine B.,"Bethesda, MD",11/21/2017,4 star rating,"Really loved it here! I thought the food and ambiance was amazing but was disappointed in the service. After being seated, we waited about half an hour for the waitress to even notice us. They didn't even give us a menu or even take our drinks which was really strange and made our lunch a lot longer than it needed to be. Once we finally got the attention of a waitress, things were great but it was extremely irritating being ignored. In terms of food, I really enjoyed everything I ate and loved the ginger margarita. It wasn't too sweet and was probably one of the best margaritas I've ever had. If the service was better, I would have definitely given 5 stars but the lack of attention to our table deteriorated our dining experience. I will give this place another chance and hope that we get more attention next time."
Erica W.,"Miami, FL",12/21/2018,3 star rating,"Wow just came from abc kitchen, what a disappointment. We ordered the cheese and meat platter, crab toast, calamari, one spinach pizza. What do you think would come first? I would expect the cheese and meat. Well they offered to bring it after our main course. No thanks. Highly recommend the crab toast. Everything else I could do without. The pizza- couldn't get past the salt.  Calamari could taste the pretzel. Drinks are good. Would stick to those and the crab toast."
Lori L.,"New York, NY",3/11/2014,4 star rating,"Despite the fact that I had already made my way over to ABC Kitchen for brunch, I couldn't turn down the invitation to try it again for dinner. Thus, I found myself back in the whimsical, semi-ethereal dining room on a Sunday evening, looking forward to trying a different selection of plates for the night.I'll avoid repeating what my previous review already covered in terms of decor and the philosophy behind the food served, but it's worth noting (again) the importance the restaurant places on utilizing fresh, organic ingredients and taking advantage of the farm-to-table concept as much as possible. Our group was able to order a variety of plates and share a few of them, so I'll simply dive into the specific plates:The Whole Wheat Mushroom Pizza should not be missed, and is easily shareable between any number of people. The pizza crust is substantial and crisp, and the melted parmesan cheese on top is complimented with mushrooms, oregano, and a barely-cooked farm egg in the center. The addition of the egg is ingenious, adding a certain richness to each bite, although it's rather difficult to split this component between four or five people. Use it as an excuse to commandeer it onto your own plate, if possible.The Akaushi Cheeseburger is a rather pricey item at $24, but is one of the more enjoyable burgers that I've found in the city. The meat comes from Akaushi cattle, which is particularly known for their marbled meat, and is a promising start to crafting a juicy patty. The burger is served on a lightly toasted Eli's bun, topped with grated Cato Corner Bloomsday cheese, and served with a fragrant and creamy arugula and basil mayo... but that's not all. The finishing touch is a spread of pickled jalapeno peppers placed on the other half of the bun, and the aggregate bite is an incredible array of flavors and textures. In your delight, don't forget the side of herbed fries that are served with their house-made ketchup.In sum: ABC Kitchen is a foolproof decision for brunch and dinner. You'll find the same commitment to high-quality, delicious food with a low-key setting that's still worthy of a night out. Don't be misled by the emphasis placed on ""organic"" and ""farm-to-table"" cooking; in the end, they still focus on the end product, and it consistently delivers a seamless dining experience."
Erin W.,"Manhattan, NY",12/29/2018,3 star rating,"Went there today and we were pretty let down, honestly. The service was fine, but the food was really mediocre. I expected so much more from such a hyped up, expensive spot. The dessert was the high point and the only thing that I couldn't cook better myself. It was pretty fun people watching, but there are much better places to eat."
Cheryl K.,"Union Square, Manhattan, NY",11/13/2018,1 star rating,"TL;DR: Double check your bill! They added $2-3 extra to EACH DISH on the bill, without saying anything. Don't know how long they've been doing this and how much extra money they've made.I've been wanting to try ABC Kitchen for the longest time, and I finally got to last night. The food was as good as I expected it to be, the ambiance was romantic, and the servers were friendly. However, last night's experience only deserves 1 star and here's why:Our table reservation for 8 people at 9pm wasn't available until 9:30. For a restaurant that asks for a credit card on file for a party larger than 5, you'd think that they would be more prepared to seat such a big party; thus, we got 2 complimentary ricotta squash toast for the table. The biggest problem lies after dinner. When we got the bill, I saw that my sea bass was $36, $3 more than what it was priced on the menu. Then my friends checked their orders and we realized all our orders were $2-3 more than what the menu stated. We were also charged for the ""complimentary squash toast"" and a beer that we never ordered. If I hadn't caught that mistake, we would've paid an extra $56, not including tax and tip. ABC Kitchen's reasoning was that they changed the pricing of the food on the POS system but not on their physical menu that they give to costumers. They honored the price that was printed but they should have mentioned the price change or updated their menu. I don't know how long they've been doing this and how much they've scammed from their customers."
Lauren B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",7/31/2019,2 star rating,"Food was good, service was pretty disappointing. Our waitress kept disappearing and didn't consistently check on us. Definitely could have been better."
Patrick P.,"New York, NY",1/29/2017,5 star rating,"Until I went to Blue Hill at Stone Barns, this place did the whole organic, local, veggie thing better than any other.  Everything here was fantastic.  The crab toast.  The beets and yogurt.  Best of all was the crispy pork confit smoked bacon marmalade and braised turnips.  Really really good."
Nadia B.,"Toronto, Canada",9/29/2018,5 star rating,"i came to new york for a long weekend and spontaneously decided to check out ABC kitchen on a friday night. i don't know which lovely person was looking over me, but i only had to wait five minutes before getting a really cozy table. the crab toast was stupid good. the lobster was so worth the $$$ and incredibly fresh. the service/aesthetic was so great. i loved it."
Mike C.,"Tuckahoe, NY",10/20/2016,5 star rating,"The food was great. But I came away most impressed by how beautifully decorated the space is. Sort of a modern industrial chic, but as my wife pointed out, it didn't feel ""cold."" Dimly lit, but each table had a focused light on it so that you didn't have to squint to read the menu. Tables packed in fairly tightly, but just far enough away that you didn't feel you were eavesdropping on your neighbors' conversation.I was also very impressed by our server, Alex. He was polite and quiet, but very knowledgeable about the menu. I love when waiters can tell you, in detail, how each dish is made. It's especially useful when a restaurant has so many great options!Our delicious cocktail choices were the ginger martini and the thyme lemonade. Just different enough to feel special. For our first course, we ordered the crab toast and a small portion of the ricotta ravioli. For our mains, my wife had the fig, prosciutto, arugula and chili pizza, while I had the pork confit (Alex's recommendation). The pork was falling-apart tender, but deliciously crispy on the outside. Came with a tasty bacon marmalade, turnips and some mashed potatoes. My wife enjoyed her pizza as well.For dessert, we had the green apple sorbet (yum!) and chocolate cake with ganache and toasted marshmallow icing. Alex was also kind enough to ask if we were celebrating any occasions (it was our anniversary), so he brought out two small cupcakes with candles in them. A beautiful touch from a masterfully orchestrated restaurant. We will be back!"
Nida K.,"London, United Kingdom",2/23/2014,3 star rating,"I've been wanting to come here for years. My friends raved about this place but i could never get a reservation on short notice. I was so excited, I came a day before my actual reservation. Oops. The atmosphere was stunning. It was like being in the wonderland of Narnia or something. I don't know why I said that, but that's what it reminded me of. We got the favorites like crab toast and mushroom pizza but none of it really impressed me. The food overall seemed pretty standard. Such a shame too because I was expecting to have an amazing meal. Nothing stood out. For the amount of money you spend here, I think there are plenty more value for money restaurant options in NYC."
Yu Z.,"Norfolk, VA",6/27/2014,5 star rating,"1,390 reviews...590 of them 5-stars. I'm sure my fellow Yelpers who wrote the 5-star reviews have touched on every major point on how amazing this place is..from the cute, warm decor, to the fresh, organic and unique menu..My friend and I came here for lunch. We had a salmon sashimi on toast for the apps, which was delicious! She had a crunchy shrimp salad w/ carrot sesame dressing, which was pretty good. I'm not a big fan of salads, but that dressing was very good. Shrimp could have been more crunchy. My mushroom, cheese and egg pizza was superb. Rich and flavorful. Dessert, we shared 3 scoops of sorbet; Rhubarb, Mint Chocolate and Salty Caramel. Overall experience, this place was awesome! Amazing food, stellar service and unique interior.. I'll be returning here in the future for sure."
Joanna H.,"New York, NY",6/10/2014,5 star rating,"This place made me realize once more, famous chefs are not famous for no reason.Shaved raw fluke, asparagus, radish, chilies, and lemon-yogurt was the best of the night. All of this is on too of a toast and the green fluke may disgust you at first but the first bite of the crunchy toast with the succulent flavors will absolutely drop your jaw. Just order this...We also got the pretzel dusted calamari as our second appetizer. Probably one of the best calamaris I ever had because it wasn't dripping in oil and the breading was still crisp. I recommend this too but if there's something else you have in mind to order, go for it. For our entrees, we got the  wood oven roasted lobster, slowly cooked salmon. I think the lobster is definitely worth getting. You'll notice all the customers around you get this. This says something. The salmon will melt in your mouth but prob won't hurt to try sth else too. The lobster and fluke dish made me want to come back but so much with the salmon.The chocolate cake with malted chocolate ganache with toasted marshmallow icing finished the night. Our waitress mentioned their homemade icecream flavors were popular but I was in the moor for chocolate. Very good, not too heavy than it sounds, moisty cake, unique due to the marshmallow which balances the sweetness of the chocolate. Again, I really liked it but I want to try something else next time. The service is great.Atmosphere is great to come w a date or friends, family. I def want to come back."
Colleen S.,"Los Angeles, CA",10/5/2016,3 star rating,"The food was great, I'll start there. The chicken, kale salad and sashimi were really well done. Typically I'm not a fan of kale but it was delicious. The chocolate cake was divine. The service was awful however. Our waiter dissapeared endlessly and seemed to provide other tables great service but all we were served was an attitude. Definitely put a damper on the experience. Probably wouldn't come back but worth trying."
Ariella F.,"Chicago, IL",11/11/2018,2 star rating,"Sad to say my guests and I just had a sour experience at ABC kitchen today. We arrived at 2pm for our 2pm reservation. We sat at 2:35. Around 2:45pm I went back to the host desk to ask if there was a server assigned to our section as we wanted water and menus. Shortly thereafter, we were greeted with menus and water and I asked to speak with a manager. She came over and I informed her about the wait. Her response was: ""We know."" No apology or anything!Eventually we were able to give a server our order. 3 house cocktails and the squash toast and crab toast to start, followed by the  carrot and avocado salad with chicken, the fried oysters and eggs and the burger cooked medium for our entrees.The appetizers arrived before the drinks. The burger  arrived well done and had to be sent back. Otherwise the food was tasty and up to their usual standards. The second burger arrived cooked to medium and shortly after, our server dropped off a carrot and avocado salad to ""keep us busy while we waited for the burger."" It seemed so strange to offer a dish that was already on the table and the timing was clearly far off. The gesture was appreciated though as it was the first acknowledgement that anyone who worked there had made to our poor service. We had it wrapped to go since we already had one at the table.We ordered another round of drinks and the sundae and cookie plate for dessert. Eventually, since each interaction with anyone took ages, we paid in full for our meal. At that point, there was almost no one left in the restaurant but things still seemed to take forever to get done.I've been going to ABC kitchen, Cocina and ABCV for years and have celebrated birthdays, anniversaries etc. there. I used to look forward to ""wow-ing"" visitors there but sadly, it seems the customer service has taken such a turn for the worst that I doubt I will return again. 2 stars for the chef. Zero for the service. At around $100 per person, I expect much better."
Ronnie K.,"New York, NY",7/10/2016,4 star rating,"After spending a few weeks trying to get a dinner reservation at a normal hour for my husband's birthday, I did get a table on a Sunday night at 5:30, right when the restaurant opens for dinner. It was nice to be one of the first to walk in when the restaurant was calm and quiet. We waited at the bar and I got a raspberry Bellini which was strong and sweet. The interior was beautifully done with a clean and modern yet rustic feel and as my husband noted, the restaurant probably used the very dishes that are sold at ABC carpet and home. (Make sure to take a stroll around the store, which is connected to the restaurant). Our server was attentive, polite and knowledgeable--one of the better experiences we've had in the city with servers. He recommended the roasted carrot and avocado salad and it was unique and delicious. The heat of the spice in the carrots was balanced nicely by the cooling avocado. We also got the cured meats and local cheeses which was good and fresh, but not amazing. We were most excited for the pasta with veal meatballs (veal was good but would have liked the pasta less al dente) but what was EXCELLENT was the mushroom with farm egg pizza. Don't be a snob, just order the pizza at this fancy pants restaurant and you won't regret it lol. The mushrooms were so savory on top of the creamy cheeses and the crust was one of the best given that it came out of a wood oven. When you hit the yolk, it's out of control creaminess :9 We also had the crispy pork confit which had a nice, crispy skin and tender chunks of meat. But honestly, after the pizza, it was hard to be impressed. But of course, we couldn't leave without eating dessert. I know everyone raves about the sundae with salted caramel ice cream and popcorn, but we wanted something light so we ordered the toasted almond panna cotta with glazed apricot and apricot sorbet. It was just the right dessert for us because it was light and refreshing. They also brought out a chocolate cupcake with ""happy birthday"" written on the plate, which was a nice touch. They don't sing at ABC kitchen, they're too classy for that lol. All in all, we had a great experience here and would come back...to try the decadent sundae and see Jean-Georges :)"
Roxanna A.,"Redwood City, CA",7/1/2018,2 star rating,"Our waiter paid little attention to us, which is HIGHLY disappointing for a $40/plate restaurant. I had to ask everyone 1-2x and when I could, him, for butter, bread, water, sharp knife for meat, where our appetizer was (came out same time as dinner), to clear our plates, clean the table, the check. Food was fine. Nothing spectacular. Two big notes: both the lighting was low and the volume was very loud in the restaurant. I could not even see my food and what I was eating. I think Edison bulbs are cool too. But I have to see my food. I didn't sign up for blind dining. It took away from any enjoyment or  ambiance."
Annie T.,"Oklahoma City, OK",1/23/2015,5 star rating,"Such a beautiful night! It's been recommended by a few people that I go here and boy do my friends know me well, it was perfect. My two sisters and sister's boyfriend indulged in an amazing meal. I loved the all white tables and chairs with candles and dim lights. It has such a romantic enchanted feeling to it. I also loved the mismatched China for dinnerware.We were celebrating so we went all out. Started with the crab toast, roasted carrot and avocado salad and the roasted butternut squash and hazelnut appetizers! All amazing! For our mains we got the lobster, cod, halibut and Brussels sprout pizza. The fish was all cooked perfectly and the Brussels sprout pizza had a definite wow factor. It had jalepenos and lots of garlic! At first it didn't come out right so instead the servers brought an order of komboucha squash toast while they fixed the pizza. Awesome customer service and the toast was amaze! We weren't done here though, the salted caramel sundae and complimentary chocolate truffle cake pops sealed the deal. Service was impeccable and it was a perfect night! I'll be back ABC!"
Celicious A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",8/20/2017,3 star rating,Came for RW week lunch.Appetizer: fluke with shaved horseradish. I find raw fluke to be bland so the horseradish added a nice kick.Main: angel hair pasta with basil and ricotta cheese. Pasta was swimming in the olive oil and you can probably make a better version of it at home.Dessert: chocolate cake with toasted marshmallow icing.Good!I'll have to try the regular menu at ABC kitchen another time!
Cuppy E.,"Long Island, NY",7/7/2014,5 star rating,"I made a reservation at ABC Kitchen after hearing that Chef Dan Kluger would be leaving at the end of June. I was on vacation two weeks ago therefore I couldn't make it here before he left. I haven't been here since 2010 and the food was still as amazing as the last time I was here. The new head chef and staff have worked with Dan for years. Hopefully they can keep up the great job.I ordered the Crab toast with lemon aioli and the fried organic chicken. The crab toast was fantastic. Not too salty with a generous amount of crab sprinkled atop perfectly toasted sourdough bread. The fried chicken was fantastic. It isn't really fried but rather flash fried somehow creating an amazingly light and crispy batter. It wasn't greasy or heavy at all. Very moist and tender and it comes with a delicious hot butter sauce and a side of sautéed spinach. Amazing. My fiancé ordered the roasted portabella and the entree portion of the Kasha and bowtie pasta. The veal meatballs in the pasta were a little salty for him but he still enjoyed his dish. You can order this as an appetizer as well. I would suggest that you order the smaller portion of this and get something else as an entree.We had to save room for the sundae with salted caramel ice cream, popcorn and chocolate sauce. I was only able to eat three spoonfuls of this but it was amazing.The cocktails here are great. I ordered the vodka thyme lemonade and the ginger margarita. They were very good with the lemonade being the better of the two.The service was excellent. We can't wait to come back!"
Faezeh A.,"Manhattan, NY",2/7/2019,3 star rating,"The place is nice, with good ambiance but the food is just ok. When you go to Jean Gorges restaurant your expectations are higher.

It was not!When my gf asked to meet for drinks somewhere and suggested ABC Kitchen i jumped at the opportunity. They have the entire menu available at the bar which is great. I got 2 drinks. The first one was the ginger margarita. So good! it packed a punch and had this ginger salt around the rim i loved. My next drink , since i couldnt decide between these two was the basil daiquiri. This as well was strong and delicious. When i return i wouldnt be able to decide between the two and probably order both again.... yes i like my drinksWe shared the mushroom, oregano and farm egg pizza. It was not too big, perfect for 2 people to share and was delicious. I cant wait to return to order this again and many other things as everything on the menu sounds great."
Monica M.,"Brooklyn, NY",2/2/2019,2 star rating,"Such a frustrating evening. We were relaxed and happy and ready for a great meal when we arrived. The beauty of going to a restaurant of this caliber is that you know that you can relax and be taken care of. But that was not to be. We ordered a bottle of wine within a few minutes of sitting down. Then ordered food. They brought the food, which we had hoped to enjoy with the wine. So we just looked at it as it got cold whole we waited for the wine. We had started off the evening deep in conversation- like all great meals, we were ready to settle in and talk and enjoy the night. But the runners brought each dish within minutes of each other. By the third dish, the table was too crowded, so we asked the runner to hold off and let us finish. And still, no wine. After asking about the wine for a third time, it finally arrived along with a half hearted apology from our waiter. We mentioned to him that we had sent the third dish back, and that we just wanted to finish the first two.   He apologized. Thirty seconds later, the runner appeared with the third dish. We tried to make room and sipped our wine, trying to remember what we had been taking about. The food was... fine? Not bad? (The crab was really fresh. I liked the mushrooms a lot.)It just feels crappy to pay so very much for fine dining and to get such stunning mediocrity of presentation. And in a city with the most astounding dining experiences!What a huge operation, and yet completely devoid of pride and soul. Let the tourists enjoy it. The city has so much more to offer. This place has jumped the shark."

I only had to wait 45 minutes so During my wait I had the ""big apple"" which was delicious .. Apple ginger and vodka yummm I loved the vibe, dark lighting and cute farm sort of decorations.  White chairs and some of the tables look like tree trunks.  You know this place Is good because it was packed.We were seated in the very back of the back room which was kind of disappointing and my only complaint of the evening.  I know I am a walk in but sit me in the room where there is a large birthday party ? And so close to the store it felt like we were not in he restaurant but I did not deduct a star for this. The food was delicious..per other yelper suggestions we started with the crab toast which was AMAZINg.  I wanted to eat it all for myself.  For or mains we had the sea bass and salmon and a side of Brussel sports both which were outstanding.  I will be back and can't wait to try other items on the menu !!!!!"

All the dishes were delicious and their ingredients were farm fresh organic. The space was entirely beautiful and filled with so much high energy!We'll definitely be back soon to participate in their $25 pre-fixe lunch option which we thought was very appealing.Jean George, you never let us down."
William H.,"Los Angeles, CA",12/7/2011,5 star rating,"I definitely still stand by their carrot and avocado salad as one of the best salads ever (even my more picky sister loved it). But upon second dining I have realized a pattern where some of the items are either too salty or unevenly salted (gazpacho, brussel sprouts, parsnips). I loved the light tempura fried kabocha with maple syrup and goat cheese, and the service was again excellent. My smores cake was good, i liked the toasted marshmallow icing."

I brought my younger sister here during her stay with me in NY over the summer and our meal here, to this day, is one of my fondest dining experiences! The crab toast is a must.

Ali M.,"New York, NY",2/18/2016,4 star rating,"IN SHORT: In the ground floor of ABC Carpet and Home, alongside the Latin-inspired ABC Cocina, lies ABC Kitchen, Jean-Georges Vongerichten's tribute to upscale, organic cuisine.THE STORY: When it comes to creating a restaurant, Jean-Georges Vongerichten is an expert at many things, not the least of which are the quality and creativity of the food emerging from the kitchen. Indeed, from a perfectly cooked piece of particularly herbal sea bass, to an addictively salty sweet pea guacamole, Mr. Vongerichten's empire has produced so many signature dishes that we sometimes forget new plates when they show up on the menu.Yet despite these plates of food that we just can't stop thinking about, Mr. Vongerichten's greatest talent may be his utterly unrivaled ability to craft a sense of place in his restaurants so articulately and so completely.So, missing your second home in Easthampton with its open, airy living space complete with artfully mismatched chairs made from reclaimed driftwood? Nostalgic for the way your staff acted at your Memorial Day party, with just the right amount of warmth and aloofness? Especially yearning for those summer afternoons when you could muse over the organic selections at Citarella while sipping fair trade coffee with the Barefoot Contessa herself?No? Really?? Well, ABC Kitchen thinks you do, and is here to provide all the upscale rusticity and shockingly good organic cuisine your sophisticated heart desires.Everyone who is anyone is raving about the Crab Toast, deliciously pink and briny with the juiciest citrus flavor from the lemon aioli, but people are also talking about the Roast Carrot and Avocado Salad, a deceptively simple dish that packs plenty of flavor and texture with crunchy seeds, sour cream, and citrus for a light, healthful finish.Shaved Raw Fluke presents a lovely, elegant marriage between the naturally sweet fish and marinated apples, while mint adds a compelling spicy, herbal note to balance everything out. If the plates ever feel like they lack a warm, more personal touch, it is only because Jean-Georges, like one's many summer cocktail parties, is so prolific. Tuna Sashimi can be found on the same menu, marinated with ginger and mint for a more Asian-inspired interpretation of the favorite dish.Pastas are the most mediocre options on the menu, and the Kasha and Bowtie Pasta is often too chewy and gummy, taking away from the tender pleasure found in the veal meatballs accompanying it. Pizzas, however, could certainly make an appearance on the table, particularly the mushroom, parmesan, and oregano pie topped with a delicately cooked farm egg, full of creamy, savory bites and just enough hearty, crusty texture.Still doesn't remind you of that perfect weekend at the end of summer when you sat in the sand in your $800 dress and nibbled on sustainably sourced caviar? No? Well perhaps this kind of loud, exhaustive, high-voltage atmosphere isn't for everyone. But at ABC Kitchen, the food is great, the room is pretty, the company is attractive, and sometimes it's worth feeling like you belong so inherently to this type of place."
Bell A.,"New York, NY",8/26/2018,5 star rating,One of my favorite spots in the city! The ambiance is beautiful and romantic. I love the food and I always have a great experience here.
Monica R.,"JAMAICA, NY",12/31/2018,1 star rating,I went here with my sister and fiancé. It is very dark and extremely difficult to read the menu. The wait staff was great but the food was horrible. My sister ordered the fried chicken and it looked like someone threw up on the plate. I ordered the squash pasta which was too gooey with cheese. My fiancé got the pork chops which were RAW. He didn't bother to send it back because he lost his appetite. The bill was nearly $300 and the food was pure GARBAGE. Never going here again.
C T.,"Philadelphia, PA",2/5/2019,5 star rating,"Always solid, on point and wonder experience. It's to me a good representation of New York new American food."
Jeff G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",6/15/2020,5 star rating,"Nyc classic. Really nice bustling interior. Awesome service and range of great food and drinks. Feels cozy, casual but makes you feel like you are in the center of city dining. Try there vegan restaurant too ABCV - more airy and stark but great choices as well."
Tunaidi A.,"Manhattan, NY",7/5/2016,3 star rating,"ABC Kitchen is pretty decent. The decor, the service, the space is top notch. The food is good too, with farm-to-table being the theme. However, I'm not so sure the price point matches the final products. Nothing is too special or out of the ordinary."
Sahar J.,"Berkeley, CA",12/30/2018,2 star rating,"Gosh, I'm irritated at how bland their food was! I couldn't believe what they were serving at this joint. $20 for mushroom appetizer that was literally just 3 mushrooms cut into small pieces with cold oil poured over them! Pizza was so bland. None of the flavors popped. Even the starter bread they brought out was tasteless and left so much to be desired. Simply put- Service was good, food was not."
Tara T.,"Somerset, NJ",2/10/2015,3 star rating,"3 stars based on the food.. Super cute place, loved the fresh flowers, the vintage style plates, rustic tables and wonderful service.  However, the appetizers and entrée themselves did not amaze me and was actually too greasy. Dessert was delicious, but the combination was a bit safe and didn't leave too much memories behind. We ended up paying average of $70 (without alcohol) for dinner. I guess the organic ingredients explained the price.The highlight for this place was only the decorations and the service for me. The waiters were extremely polite, knowledgeable about their menus and was not pushy at all. However it's really a pity that they didn't have enough flavor and spirit in their food to match the lovely ambience."
Shradha A.,"Austin, TX",7/4/2014,4 star rating,"When I saw the menu online prior to going, I didn't fully understand why this place is one of NYC's 15 toughest tables to get. It listed salads, pastas and pizzas - regular Mediterranean dishes. When we arrived though, I was really impressed by the ambiance. It was such a perfect paradox of being earthy yet stylish, rustic yet modern! Loved the wooden pillars with traditional chandeliers. The lighting was just right - you could see your food but shroud your dining companion in a neat shadow. Service was casual but professional. They said that it took too long to bring out our pizza, so they gave us a complimentary beet salad while we waited. We also got the carrot avocado salad and really enjoyed it! The cavatelli pasta was really good - yummy mushroom broth! The pizza with an egg on it was unique, and good. The most surprising part was the price - we only paid $60 pp and also ordered cocktails."
Jessica B.,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",1/9/2016,1 star rating,Really disappointed by my experience here from start to finish. Honestly have no idea what the hype was about. Yes the decor is beautiful and the vibe is nice but the food is not special at all and the service was not impressive. We had a reservation at 10 we weren't seated until 10:30. The sparkling water tasted like carbonated tap water. The restaurant is freezing and horribly drafty to the point where I had to go get my coat from coat check and wear it during the meal - I'm the kind of person that is alway hot. Everything was very spicy with no mention of this on the menu. Started with the tuna sashimi it was fine. The kashi pasta wasn't al dente it was hard and undercooked. We asked how the cauliflower starter was prepared it was insanely spicy and this was never mentioned. The lentil soup tasted like lawn clippings. The lobster was also undercooked and parts were raw - opaque raw. Everyone at our table has eaten lobster MANY times and at much nicer restaurants and this was raw. The manager came up to us and told us she checked with the chef and they were in fact not raw. I'm sorry you don't tell the customer they are wrong. Ever. Especially at a place that is supposed to be so fabulous.....Wouldn't ever come back and wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Don't be deceived by the presentation of the food in photos.
Asuka N.,"New York, NY",1/26/2016,4 star rating,"After the huge winter storm blew over, we were lucky enough to find an early dinner reservation at ABC Kitchen - a place that I've always felt was pretty difficult to score a seat at. Although it was pretty empty when we showed up at 5:30 on a Sunday evening, it was definitely much more packed when we headed out a little before 7. The decor has a very similar feel to ABC Cocina, albeit a tad more intimate, with the ceilings being lower. That said, the noise was pretty manageable despite the low ceiilngs; if anything, the racket caused by the heating pipes coming to life was louder than anything else. Our waitress was very efficient  in taking our order and getting food plated, although it may have been that she was on her way out (the check was brought by someone else at the end of the meal). I had the mezcal paloma - a bit light for my tastes, and with salt way too far down on the glass - and the beer menu was somewhat disappointing - but that didn't hamper my impressions of the food.We started off with bread for the table - warm and chewy, very good for dipping in the olive oil provided; I did like the crystal salt that was provided as well to give it a bit more taste. We then started out with the best dish of the night, which was the crab toast. Such great flavor and moistness, contrasted against the crunchiness of the toast, made for some seriously tasty bites. When I come back, that is definitely one to repeat. The tuna sashimi was really good in the ginger and mint flavoring; arguably, the ginger in the sauce was a tad overdone (it was almost a bit spicy), but I really liked the strong flavor. Frankly, it was also needed because the cut of tuna wasn't the best - definitely more on the chewy side, and not something you'd see at a sushi restaurant - but I liked it nonetheless, as it allowed the sauce to really get soaked up into the fish. The roasted cauliflower, to be honest, was probably my least favorite dish here. Served almost like a toast, the onions and walnuts tasted more like a very generic spicy tomato sauce, and the fried egg didn't really work with it either. The pasta was better; the fettuccine with the basil-pistachio pesto (and a load of nuts to boot) had a very warm, earthy flavor to it. The brussel sprouts helped make the very green dish have a very homey feel to it, too. We finished up by splitting the lobster. Pretty tasty overall, with the lemon-chili vinaigrette definitely detectable from the heat in each bite. The meat was pretty flavorful, although I would say that at the menu price, I thought it was a little bit on the high end. The desserts were above-average, like the rest of the meal, as well. We shared the donuts; my favorite was definitely the Boston Creme imitation, while the lemon-glazed donut was a very tart take on a glazed donut. The spiced apple cider was a bit generic; I've never been an apple-infused donut guy, so that probably explains why I didn't really have much of a reaction to that one. The chocolate cake was very good, but somewhat standard; the main thing I liked about it was the toasted marshmellow 'frosting' around the edge; that gave a nice, chewy contrast to the decadence of the cake.Overall, the food here was very solid, although I would say that I did like my experience at ABC Cocina a bit better overall. I'd definitely come back, but I would probably check out some of the other dishes, as well as keep an eye on the check (it does add up pretty quickly here, especially when you are hungry after being snowed in). A great place for a cozy dinner that has a laid-back, chill feel to it."
Ponez M.,"Jersey City, NJ",8/23/2014,2 star rating,"I'd like to give this place more stars for the food, because I really enjoyed it - once we finally received it. We didn't have reservations but the host condescendingly informed us we could sit at the tiny hallway bar, because they didn't have tables open. I'd have no problem with this, if not for the fact that the entire time we were there (and it was a WHILE) more than 50% of their tables remained empty. I read another review in which the person felt they were treated like 2nd class citizens; that's exactly how it felt to us, too. Despite being stuck in steerage, we remained optimistic after hearing such rave reviews. Unfortunately, once you're tagged and branded as chattel, you're SOL at this place. No less than four bartenders ran back and forth in front of us and we weren't able to even order our drinks for another 15-20 min. Then it was probably half an hour until we received them. The food ordering and receiving probably took another 45 min.Food: pancakes with lemon curd were delicious, and the cucumber cocktail was very good. But the service and treatment put such a damper on the whole experience that we probably won't be going back."
Kimi R.,"Brooklyn, NY",8/22/2016,2 star rating,"Average food, very expensive and very underwhelming service.  It's for tourists staying in nearby hotels, and is maybe perfect for that, but this is not New York at it's best, by any means."
Morgan Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",9/6/2016,4 star rating,"Came here for my friend's birthday brunch, & all I have to say are great things! The food is as fresh as it comes, all from local vendors. The decor is beautiful, service was very friendly, but best part was the food!!! The experience was one of our favorite parts of the city! We got the eggs Benedict, cheddar biscuits, fresh fruit, and mimosas!"
Danielle T.,"Port Washington, NY",1/14/2014,5 star rating,"GET THE FRIED CHICKEN! And everything else on the menu for that matter. All appetizers were delicious and since we were a large party, we were able to share a lot. From beets to Cheese etc. Entrees were delicious and arguably the best fried chicken I've had. Juicy.Great service and they never felt like they were interrupting us.  Enjoyed every second! Highly recommended."
Mark D.,"Columbus, OH",9/30/2018,5 star rating,"Perhaps one of the best meals I've had in ages. My only negative is that it is just SO packed it was hard to have a conversation with the person across the table. The service was amazing, and clearly then chef cares about what is put out. I loved every morsel. I will be back for sure."
Kira T.,"Manhattan, NY",3/22/2019,1 star rating,"This review is for the treatment I got over the phone. I called to make a reservation and the lady was very cold and rude to me. At the end when there was no available spot for us at the time we wanted, I said ""Thank you, Ill call back"" and she just hang out on me. That's not the way to treat the clients"
Goodvibes H.,"Manhattan, NY",8/17/2016,5 star rating,Did a LOT of research on which dishes to order before coming here to celebrate my mom's bday with the family.Here's my two cents on things you MUST order (based on 6 peoples' opinions at the table)Carrot and avocado saladHeirloom tomatoes bruschetta Fried chickenMushroom pizza Sundae Things that you may consider:Crab (thought it would be better based on other reviews)Beets and YogurtService was great- they are very warm and friendly.
Kristen H.,"Costa Mesa, CA",10/3/2018,5 star rating,"This was a meal I won't soon forget. The cocktails are fun and fresh and the food is unbelievably flavorful, especially given that it's mostly vegan. The staff were really friendly and the all-white ambience with a warm glow is really beautiful."
brigitte k.,"New York, NY",6/6/2016,5 star rating,A very classy and beautiful space. Excellent food and great service. My waiter was a Shakespearean actor and so attentive and sweet. Its pricey but worth it.Ambiance is fantastic.
Megan D.,"Chantilly, VA",8/7/2017,4 star rating,"I'm visiting New York for two days so I saw the reviews for this place & decided to come. Honestly I'd give this a 4.5 (Yelp should give us that option), & the only thing keeping it from a 5 is the price. The food and service was fantastic. The ambiance was nice, one of the nicest interiors of a restuarant I've ever seen. We got a mixed drink I can't remember the name, it came in a pretty small glass & costs 18$!! For three ppl the bill after a roughly 20% tip came to be over $160, that's pretty expensive. But I can't deny the salmon was delicious, I had the pork confit which I loved (it was pretty small though), and my parents loved the calamari so we had a good time. So 4 stars cuz we were there for just a little less than an hour & unless you've got plenty of dough to spend, Id just eat somewhere less pricier or try out this place once if you'd like."
Steven C.,"Warren, NJ",8/7/2017,5 star rating,"Been going here for years and it is still amazing! Reservations are highly recommended. Unless you want to just stroll thru and eat by the bar or if you are lucky you might get a table.Tried almost everything on their menu besides their whole wheat pizzas.You can not go wrong with their crab toast, tuna sashimi marinated with ginger/mint and any od their seafood entrees. My favorite is the black sea bass.The bad.My least favorite was their fried organic chicken and their very uncomfortable seating chairs. Seems strange for a furniture store to provide their customers with the most uncomfortable chairs I have sat in.Otherwise if you are looking for delicious local organic food in the city with great wine and cocktail menu with a vibrant atmosphere and trendy crowd, ABC Kitchen is your spot. Highly recommended!"
Shalizeh D.,"Torrance, CA",3/3/2014,4 star rating,ABC kitchen is a beautifully decorated restaurant with a well executed menu and trained staff. The downside - you need reservations 31 days in advance and at 9 AM sharp (for a group of 6). The upside - everything else. We ordered a plethora of small plates to share. The homemade ricotta cheese is everything! The squash toast was really good. It was savory and combined with the fresh bread and ricotta it was close to perfection. The ricotta alone was a dish and it was excellent! The crab toast was pretty good but I enjoyed the squash more. Then there was the salmon sashimi style which was paired with a gingery mint dressing. Very well paired. The ravioli was just good. The mashed potatoes were a buttery heaven. We also enjoyed the hand crafted cocktails. Try the basil like dacquiri. You won't be sorry! Why didn't I give it 5 stars? The donuts were ok at best and the reservations could be less of a hassle but what do you expect for such an amazing spot?!
Misa H.,"New York, NY",4/2/2017,4 star rating,"Beautiful restaurant with tasty organic dishes. Nice atmosphere. Great for a date or a fancy night out with family/friends. On pricy side, but not unreasonable since it is Manhattan.We shared salad, crab toast, kabocha squash toast, and we each had an entree. I had salmon, it was good! My friend had today's special, steak - it looked very small in portion for $52."

Dione D.,"New York, NY",2/13/2016,4 star rating,"Yum yum yum!  So glad I was finally able to make it here (thank you BB!).  The space is so cool - industrial but sexy and chic.  Only bad thing about the decor was that we were seated in front of a heat pipe that kept knocking... so hard you could just see the picture in front of it bounce each time.  Oy.Cocktails: - pear 'n whiskey - cider and honey whiskey.  I don't usually order the same drink twice during dinner, but I had to get this twice.  Boozy but a touch of sweet and didn't feel too strong.- blood orange negroni - I don't like any of the words in that phrase, but my dining companion very much enjoyed it.  Appetizers: - crab toast with lemon aioli - the toast is thick and crunchy, and the crab is shredded and light/tasty, especially with a squeeze of lemon!- pretzel dusted calamari - delicious!  A little salty but yummy.  I liked the spicy tomato sauce... but I didn't think the mustard aioli went well with the dish.Entrees: - crispy pork confit - omg.  the pork was so tender, and the skin was so crispy!  delicious.  Don't try to eat the green garnish thing though. - skuna bay salmon - cooked to medium perfectly.  The carrot sauce was delectable - very carroty but also very sweet.  - shared a side of brussel sprouts.  Decent amount of bacon (small, thick, crispy pieces) but just a few tiny pieces of diced pears.Dessert: - shared the donuts.  The apple cider one seemed really hard when we cut it, but it was delicious.  The meyer lemon glazed was one I'd never tasted anything like, and I REALLY enjoyed it.  The chocolate and vanilla donut is cream-filled.  I would highly recommend you get a coffee with the donuts.  - coffee is delicious.- also had a glass of the croteaux (sparking rose).  They don't have a moscato d-asti (my dessert beverage of choice) but it was a nice replacement.  Sweet and sparkly but not cloying.Will definitely come back as soon as I get the chance!"
Brad P.,"New York, NY",12/1/2015,4 star rating,"it's good, but I never know what to order. nothing on the menu is ever appealing. It looks good and sounds good but for some reason I never want to really order it. everytime I come here, I end up just asking the waitress what's popular and order that. anyways, quality and service is always good though! must reserve if you're coming during the rush hours"

Natalie K.,"New York, NY",1/6/2016,2 star rating,"I am probably missing out on something here... the food was average, as well as the drinks.The reservations are pain in the neck. What is there to rave about?"
Annmarie E.,"Bloomington, IN",1/25/2014,4 star rating,"I will definitely come back here when I have more money to spend. I had a good experience here, but it wasn't entirely as amazing as I was hoping. I'll say it from the start that I'm not wealthy, so forgive my complaints about the prices. I also didn't taste any drinks or dessert here yet, so consider my review incomplete until then. I'll get the petty things over with: 1. I believe you have to enter the restaurant from the street (not from within the store) to be seated. My friend and I stood at what turned out to be the exit for a few minutes before noticing everybody was entering from another side. There really should be a clear sign, or the wait staff could at least tell the visitors that they need to enter from the other side. They simply ignored us.  2. The chairs cannot hold jackets well; your jacket will fall if you drape it over the back of your chair. 3. Tiniest vases holding the tiniest flowers ever - I don't know why it annoyed me, but it did. 4. Equally tiny water glasses. I guess what annoys me the most about places like this is that they make everything so cute, minimalist, and tiny. And then you realize you are paying a lot for a cute, minimalist, and tiny experience! We had very courteous service, and my chair was even pushed in for me! That was a first! Our waiter was polite and didn't fuss about splitting our bill between two credit cards. The staff is good about being humble and not rubbing the restaurant's classiness in your face. Bread service is free, if you were wondering, but the bread is very plain. They will give you more bread, but they will not give you more olive oil or sea salt (at least not without asking). My friend and I shared the pretzel-dusted calamari. It comes with a creamy horseradish-like sauce and a spicy red sauce. It was delicious, but I personally couldn't taste any pretzel. I ordered the spinach and goat cheese pizza, which was heavenly! Oily, but heavenly. Be warned, though, that the flavors are pretty strong and you will be dying for water. It also had some hidden spice. The pizza needs a side dish so you don't get tired of the goat cheese and spinach so much.My friend ordered the ricotta ravioli. He's a big eater, so he was annoyed at how tiny his ""entrée"" portion was, and we were wondering how comically small the appetizer portion would have been. Good thing he ordered the side of fries, which were deliciously seasoned with lots of rosemary. Even the ketchup tasted delicious like it was homemade. Overall, the food was delicious and the service very, very nice. This is a very, very nice place and you should try it (and the store, while you're at it!), but it's not worth it to penny-pinch here, as I have learned. You want the full experience at a place like this, and the full experience will not be cheap. C'est la vie!"
Becca C.,"Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn, NY",4/2/2019,3 star rating,"I hate to give this 3 stars because the food here is so amazing. The first time I went here it was perfection. However, we went back last week and it was a horrible experience. We had a 8pm reservation and waited until 9:15 for our table. The waiting area was filled with people who were waiting over an hour from their scheduled reservations to be seated. I really hope they work out their kinks because I love this place!"
Manali P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",10/20/2017,5 star rating,"What do I say about ABC Kitchen that hasn't been said before. As a vegetarian, it is total paradise. The waitstaff is polite, very friendly and efficient. The menu is beautiful, super easy to understand - they basically list all the ingredients and so you have a general sense of the flavours. My absolute personal favourite entree is the homemade ricotta ravioli with herbs and tomato sauce. For dessert, I highly recommend the salted caramel sundae with popcorn, candied peanuts and hot fudge. Definitely one of my top 10 restaurants in NYC."
Agustin K.,"New York, NY",2/1/2014,5 star rating,"Review for special occasion.  Came here for a small wedding.  They do take special reservation for wedding etc.  I think it's great if you are looking for a casual setting with good food.  There isn't a private section so you will be seated with the rest of the other diners which I prefer but I guess your guests can't really mingle.They even made special menu with names of the celebrating people.  I didn't get involved with the reservation or menu selection so can't comment on that.Food was great and abundant.  Apps and dessert are to share and you can pick your entree.  I had the lobster and it was the BEST lobster I've had.  Yes even compared to Maine or Boston.  Not overcooked and so tender and juicy.  I actually are all the claws etc even with my dress and no bib!  Other things are good as well.  The food was certainly packed with heat, even for us asian  people.  Not sure if thy adjusted because we are Asian but it was pretty spicy!  I enjoyed it but a few people were struggling with the spice level.  Overall a great night for celebration."
Doreen C.,"Palo Alto, CA",12/22/2014,5 star rating,"The freshest food you can get! I've been here and twice and am always sure to stop by whenever I'm in the area. I went at prime brunch time and the wait was ~40 minutes, but they send you a text when your table's ready so had the chance to walk around the area while waiting. Ordered the biscuits for an appetizer and tried both the eggs benedict with ham and the crispy oysters with scrambled eggs. My friend had the smoked salmon, which had changed since the fist time I had been there. Everything was delicious! It is a pricey place, but definitely worth it. Service was great as well, and didn't have to wait long to be served after ordering. Will def come again!"
Saba A.,"River North, Chicago, IL",11/14/2015,4 star rating,"REALLY wanted to come here for brunch but didn't plan ahead of time so walked in on a Friday night with my girl friend without reservations at 10 pm and there was an hour and a half waitlist. We stood at the bar and yep- you can order food standing at the bar. It's not the most comfortable way to dine- but coming from DC and Chicago, we were eager to try this place for it's Michelin star and taste the french inspired food from Jean-Georges. The drink menu was expensive- but the Cabernet from Beckman Vineyards was heavy and perfect. It lasted me throughout my entire meal. For food, we ordered the tuna sashimi and don't be fooled- it was the best tasting sashimi i've ever had. It was so fresh, so tender, so wonderfully flavored, had a kick of ginger along with the soothing ingredients of mint that it was fully marinated in. We also ordered a small veal meatball pasta dish. The veal was so cooked so lightly it broke easily when I gave it a little pinch with the fork. The bowtie pasta tasted healthy and fresh and the organic. The farm to table experience spoke. The menu itself is outstanding. So many flavors to chose from all creatively listed. As far as the ambiance- brilliant. The dark lit room with rustic tables and small candlelights made you feel like you were in an outdoor brought inside wedding reception room. The wait staff is wearing plaid shirts and are very professional. Don't leave without ordering the sundae with salted caramel ice cream, candied peanuts & popcorn, whipped cream, and chocolate sauce for 14 dollars. This dessert put me in heaven. Don't let the popcorn fool you- the flavors all blended in well and it's a large sharing dish but my friend and I finished it while we were already full from dinner. So worth it. Great experience overall."
Zach W.,"Baltimore, MD",12/14/2015,5 star rating,"There's no B or C about this place, it's a straight A. You know when you're hungry and you want to drop in a cool place you've never been before? Yea don't do that here. We made our reservations two weeks in advance, so we were able to get in. It was the girlfriend's birthday so we decided to go all out and we definitely didn't leave disappointed. To start, we were read the specials by the single worst waiter I've ever had, which was nice. Somehow he took five minutes to read a list of specials that included several items over $100, which was to be honest a serious misread of the night's budget.We went with three appetizers and a main course. As is tradition, we started with the Kabocha squash toast, and that's when I learned that Kabocha is a type of squash. It might have been the best toast I've ever had, so really good first impression, Kabocha. 10/10. We also got the carrot and avocado salad, which was crazy good but was still the worst thing we got. Maybe an 8?The the other stuff started coming out. We got the crab toast (we like toast apparently) and it was also delightful. It was a little surprising that it was cold, but that took away the urgency of eating it quickly while one of my favorite pizzas ever was sitting there hot. That mushroom pizza. It was awesome. The combination of mushrooms and cheese and that great crust was perfect. Totally didn't come in expecting to eat a top 10 pizza, but when life throws you a curveball, at least you get a great pizza out of it. Finally, the cherry on top of the metaphorical sundae was an actual sundae. It was MASSIVE. Like six scoops of ice cream, caramel popcorn, whipped cream, chocolate sauce, just...wow. It was perfect for five people, which would be nice except there were two of us. We left on the full side of too full, but that's ok, it was delicious. All around great meal. As I said at the top, straight A."

Priscilla C.,"Davis, CA",9/12/2016,5 star rating,"I've walked around ABC home and carpet quite a few times and every time I get to the back of the main floor, I always see this ""small"" cafe looking place where people are eating. Well little did I know, this ""small"" little appearing cafe is a huge restaurant down below. All I was seeing was just a small section. The restaurant decor is gorgeous. This restaurant is owned by the famous Jean Georges who also owns the 3 Michelin star French restaurant at 1 Central Park West (Trump International Hotel & Tower). He also owns the sister restaurant attached to ABC kitchen next door named ABC Cocina where they serve more of Latin based tapas. This man is doing it all! We ordered a prefixed ($34) with the raw tuna as starter, ravioli for entree and the salted caramel sundae for dessert. The raw tuna was very fresh and the sauce so good! The ravioli had ricotta cheese and a runny egg inside. When you cut it open, the yolk spills over the pulled pork under. I don't know what the heck they put into this dish, but the flavors were amazing. Everything went so beautifully well together. I personally had the lobster. I originally wanted the black Sea bass which I heard is super popular and wonderful, but they didn't have it today and was going to substitute with branzino fish instead which I didn't like so I went with the lobster. The lobster was roasted with some spices. The level of spice was perfect, just mild. It was simple, but somehow they still made it taste so good. Usually roasted seafoods are dry, but this restaurant was able to maintain its juiciness and texture, a plus! The crab toast appetizer was delicious. The bread was hard, but even the bread had flavor. I think they soaked it in olive oil. They use real crab meat and smear it all over the toast with a good amount of crab meat. You get 2 loaves, cut into 4 pieces. Last, but not least, the salted caramel dessert had 2 scoops of salted caramel ice cream with caramel popcorn on the sides and some fudge and peanuts. It kind of tastes like a snickers ice cream bar in some ways. It was pretty good. We also ordered a side of corn which was pretty good too. They cut the corn fresh from a cob, use their own homemade butter and threw some scallions and secret ingredients in it. This restaurant is a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for which is Jean Georges deliciousness! Now, I want to try every one of his restaurants! Supposedly, he has restaurants all around Manhattan and is simply amazing. We randomly came in as walk ins for lunch and was lucky enough to have a high bar seating table. Make reservations. The place filled up so quickly."
Mel L.,"Vancouver, Canada",2/1/2016,5 star rating,"One of our favourite NYC meals and definitely the best service we received!First off, the decor in this restaurant is cool. Loved the way the place looked with the exposed wood beams, and the mixture of natural wood and painted white for the furniture. The room felt warm and modern at the same time. When we were there, all the servers wore plaid shirts which helped them to stand out against the decor.This is probably the only restaurant we've been to in NYC where we had a reservation and they seated us BEFORE our whole party arrived! I was the first to get there and thought I would be waiting in the entrance for a while, but not the case! They seated me right away, no problem. Amazing. It was incredibly busy and packed while we were there but we never felt rushed and even after we had finished our meal and paid our bill, the servers kept coming back to refill our water glasses and make sure we were taken care of. Attentive but not overbearing. We tried several appetizers and salads, unfortunately I can't remember all of them. For entree, I had the Ricotta Ravioli which I loved. New York really knows how to do pasta right! We were stuffed by dessert but the 4 of us shared the Sundae - Salted caramel ice cream with candied popcorn and peanuts and chocolate sauce. I guess it's not really my thing (I don't love peanuts or caramel corn!) but I'm sure it would appeal to others. Wish I could comment more on the food (lack of memory, not that it was at all bad), but overall this restaurant really impressed and I would highly recommend it!"
KB B.,"Brooklyn, NY",10/4/2018,5 star rating,"Lots of ""must-try"" restaurants are overrated but ABC Kitchen is not one of them. Never went in without a reservation and I don't recommend doing so -- I've heard people can wait HOURS to get in. The ambiance is chic and it always seems to have the right ""noise"" level -- not too loud and not like a library either and it makes the dining experience wonderful.  Now, for the food and drinks. The food is fresh and delicious, and I love the combinations of things. The different menus are all good regardless of what meal you're going for -- but I've mostly been for lunch though, so I'd say go for the pasta and/or the burger when available. Also love love their fries and their seafood special is also always good.The restaurant have a great selection of wine as well and honestly if you're dining with a party, just get a bottle, it makes more sense, cost-wise. And speaking of costs, yes, it's more expensive than a lot of places even for NYC - but if you want a fresh, delicious meal that is above average cost, definitely recommend. Finally, get dessert here if you can, it's always worth it."
Tomi A.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",6/23/2017,5 star rating,The staff is really friendly and the food is so good. You tell everything is fresh and it's brought out relatively fast. I'm a fan of the organic fried chicken and the MASHED POTATOESSS.
April H.,"Brooklyn, NY",7/31/2018,1 star rating,"Okay- honestly. I can't review the food. I'll give my review though and let you decide if you want to put up with what we did to try and try this nonsense though. My fiancée and I planned to eat here tonight- a Tuesday. I called the day before and they were quite ambiguous about reservations, eventually telling us to come by tomorrow and a table would certainly be available. Uhhh.... okay?! So I called before getting on the train and asked if there was a wait and if we could get on the list. They said there was a 15/20min wait but we'd have to physically come to get on the list. Okay. So we arrive to this place and now the wait is an hour. We put our name and phone number down and left to explore a bit. As it turned out we found another place without a wait and ate there. All the while I was expecting a text from this place. We finished dinner without one. I got home (after 10, we put our names down at 8) and called. They apologized for ""forgetting us"". So yeah. We weren't going to get a table at ABC tonight. I don't think we'll be trying their food tonight or ever based on their truly terrible service."
Izzy V.,"New York, NY",4/21/2019,5 star rating,"I made a reservation for 12 pm on a Saturday for brunch for me and my mom. Service was excellent - our waitress was Emily. We ordered the pea soup, carrot and avocado salad, buttermilk pancakes w lemon curd, and bacon. Everything was delicious!! Highly recommend this place- they have something for everybody!"
Katherine S.,"Manhattan, NY",4/30/2014,5 star rating,"While a dinner reservation here is pretty challenging, you absolutely need to make it a point to visit ABC Kitchen in The Flatiron District at some dining point, where it's lunch, brunch or dinner. This Jean-Georges restaurant is everything you'd expect it to be from him, nothing shy of amazing. I'm pretty obsessed with the aesthetic here too, it's rustic, meets French countryside, meets woodland nymph. Food wise, everything here is locally sourced, organic, and, well, delicious.To start, as a snack for the table, we ordered their House Cut Fries. These are so amazing. They're perfectly seasoned, crisp herbs and rosemary really add a nice dimension to the already tasty, crisp fries.Then, I went for their prix fixe lunch menu and, for my first course I had the Line Caught Tuna Sashimi (marinated with ginger and mint). Amazing. The dish has a little bit of spice to it with a nice hint of the ginger. The tuna itself is perfect and seems to almost melt in your mouth.Next, for my entree I had their Veggie Burger (minted yogurt and housemade whole wheat pita). I loved this. First off, the burger and pita are super substantial and hearty. The veggie burger is housemade, of course, and lightly dipped in an egg bater and quickly fried, giving it a nice crisp exterior. The minted yogurt was especially nice with this too, adding a nice creaminess to the meatiness of the burger. I really loved the carrot slaw here too, they had the nicest balance in texture between being tender and crisp, and lightly dressed in an olive oil. Then, for dessert, I had the Salted Caramel Ice Cream Sundae (candied peanuts & popcorn, whipped cream, chocolate sauce). Holy $&*!. This was so incredible, it's basically heaven in a bowl. The salted caramel ice cream is rich, and silky, and almost has a burnt sugar appeal. On top is a housemade whipped cream, light and airy and not even all that sweet, balancing well with the rest of the sweet dish. The chocolate sauce on the bottom is warm, and rich and chocolaty and almost fudge like. Then, you basically have a homemade crackerjack box confecting the sundae. It's all ridiculous and insanely delicious."
Jaymie S.,"San Francisco, CA",1/22/2016,2 star rating,"Came here with a few friends for brunch on a Sunday. We had a little bit of a wait but we were able to roam around in the area while we waited since they have a text alert system. Always makes the waiting process a little easier!I loved the interior and decor, but can't say the same for the food. I was a little disappointed by the small selection, especially for the brunch options. Everything was pretty standard with your basic eggs benedict with ham, a few omelettes and scrambles, and french toast. I'm always looking for something a little more innovative especially when it comes to brunch, so I definitely had a difficult time deciding what to get. Ultimately I decided to stay away from the breakfast options and get the kasha and bowtie pasta with veal meatballs. Overall it was just okay, kind of bland and not really what I had anticipated. I think I had higher expectations for this place, so the fact that it was pretty mediocre was a let down. I know their focus is on using fresh and organic ingredients, but that doesn't mean you have to sacrifice some flavor and creativity!"
Eatamame N.,"New York, NY",9/23/2017,4 star rating,Definitely reserve before coming! I went here for dinner and waited for 1.5h. But it was worth it for their popcorn sundae!
Lauren B.,"Baltimore, MD",6/24/2014,5 star rating,"I was in New York with my boyfriend for a few days to celebrate my 22nd birthday, I had done some research on a billion restaurants in the city and ABC kitchens menu looked the most appealing to me. We walked in on a Thursday at around 6PM and got seated right away! Hostess was very friendly and accommodating. We started off with some cocktails, I got the rhubarb royale, which was OK. My boyfriend got the sour cherry old fashioned which was crazy strong, but delicious. We moved on to a bottle of red, which my boyfriend chose and it was awesome.Appetizers:Crab toast was simply amazing, wanted more! Mushroom pizza was great considering that I absolutely hate mushrooms. The egg on top was a nice touch.Entrees:My boyfriend had the sea bass which he was in love with and perfectly seasoned. I had the lobster which of course.....was lobster and was seafood heaven in my mouth.Dessert:Ate a lot for our first and second courses, so we got ice cream and a latte for myself. We got the green apple and chocolate mint sorbet and the salted caramel ice cream. The green apple was my fave. They also sent out a mini cupcake and dessert, on the house. Both very very tasty.I wish I could remember the servers names because they were lovely. Had great conversations with one of the back waiters. This is the first place that I've walked in without a reservation where the chef has sent out numerous bites from the kitchen just because...everything truly was amazing and I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a great place to eat in New York."
Jonas K.,"7, MD",5/2/2019,2 star rating,"We actually had a lot of expectations for the restaurant and had it recommended from many friends. But we were very disappointed. We got our table 20 min later than our booking and was not met with a smile, the waitress were yawning. We had to ask for bread and were not met with a smile. The ravioli dish was cold and the staff were not very committed at all."
Mary B.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",4/12/2019,5 star rating,"Wow wow wow! Such a great dining experience. We ordered the mushroom pizza, fried chicken, pesto pasta, and sea bass. The ginger margaritas were so delicious! We had to try the caramel corn sundae and sesame seed cheesecake too. The sundae blew me away! Excellent staff too. Wish I could eat my way through their menu."
Morgan D.,"New York, NY",2/15/2016,4 star rating,"Always a great spot. Haven't been there for dinner yet- brunch is very good. Always packed, always fresh food... Got the crab toast last time I was there- FAB. This time, got the omelette with ricotta and spinach... It was a little rubbery. I was disappointed. The pomegranate Bellini isn't great either... My other experiences there have been great tho! Love their salads, burgers and sandwiches. Definitely recommend!"
Toni F.,"Lemont, IL",1/2/2014,3 star rating,"We did enjoy our visit to ABC Kitchen (and Cocina for a drink after dinner) although I'm getting a bit tired of the ""sustainable"" concept that seems to be a staple of almost every menu we've seen in NY lately.  Politically, it seems to contradict the outright extravagance and commercialism that is going on right next door at ABC Home ($1000 for a small piece of pottery, are you kidding me??) It was a bit confusing to make your way into the right place...signs on the outside are very small and faint, I'm thinking that is to get you into the store first so you can shop and buy.  If you go through the Home store, the ""Kitchen"" is on the right all the way in the back and ""Cocina"" is through the doors on the left.  The place is gorgeous - right down to the white ""patio-like"" chairs and the dim lighting that perfectly accents the massive wood-beamed ceiling.  We started with cocktails and the Pretzel Crusted Calamari - a bit chewy and  ordinary - the pretzel coating didn't distinguish it from other calamari we've had in any way.  Our entrees included fish (Snapper or Salmon, I forgot which one) and the Crispy Pork with Braised Turnips and a side of their Mashed Potatoes with Sea Salt.  The mashed potatoes were by far the best item that we ordered.  I thought the pork was spongy and the bacon ""marmalade"" it was topped with had large pieces of bacon that were leather-like.  The flavor was decent but nothing special.  We didn't stay for dessert but did venture across the aisle to ABC Cocina to meet a friend for a drink.  The bartenders appeared to be very busy and it took some effort to get their attention.  The place was bustling - it is obvious this is a hot spot for more than just waiting for a table.  I wouldn't say that our experience at ABC Kitchen totally lived up to our expectations but it was enjoyable.  In my opinion, it wasn't great enough to warrant a second visit but it's something you might want to see at least once."
Theresa N.,"Flushing, NY",11/18/2015,5 star rating,"The most amazing restaurant ive been to. The food is magnificent. We ordered alot to share.

Jaz L.,"New York, NY",12/3/2015,2 star rating,"Really disappointed to our dining experience tonight. Thursday night, 6:30PM for 2 people.We made reservation 1 month earlier for the birthday dinner.---Environment---*Dining area:The decoration and ambiance of main area was beautiful and great, HOWEVER,  they sat us in the back bar area, which was a passage between ABC Kitchen, ABC Cocina, and abcmkt. It had no decoration at all. While we ate, some people were walking on the stairs above us (we were eating under the edge of stairs. I felt some dust were falling into our dishes from it...). The customers of abcmkt also randomly walked to our area and peaked into our dishes. I felt really uncomfortable about it. I understand they didn't want to waste the space and put more tables to make money, but they should probably make it only for the bar guests, not the customers who have the full dinner.*BathroomThe M/W I went was gross. Bed smell, pee on toilet seat, and toilet paper all over the floor!!---Food---*Lentil Soup: Very good. Hearty and flavorful.*Fried Calamari: ok and not memorable.*Salmon: ok and not memerable. *Red Snapper: Fish was cooked to right. Crispy skin and tender meat. However, there was too much spinach on the side. It made the dish unbalanced on both flavor and presentation.*Sundae: good idea to put salted caramel ice cream and popcorn together. It was tasty but it got very sweet at the end. The portion was big, so it's ideal to share it between 2-3 people.---Service---The staff were friendly. However, they were not attentive. It might be a busy night, so our waiter disappeared for a while time to time when we needed him. We waited for 20 mins to order dessert and 30 mins to get the bill. Some of the serving ways were also odd. Most of our dishes were dropped without any words. No greeting (we were still in the middle of conversation), no explaining, no ""bon appetit"". They just came and left like we were air...If you ask questions, they would answer politely. But it was really awkward.I've been to many high-end or Michelin starred restaurants. By the dining experience tonight, I don't think ABC Kitchen deserved Michelin 3 stars. Foods were good but not excellent, and the service, back bar area, and bathroom were not on the level. Overall, it was a disappointment."

Lynn C.,"Dix Hills, NY",3/25/2017,4 star rating,"You have to book weeks in advance to get a table at this hot spot. The space is enchantingly eclectic with various drop down lighting hanging throughout the restaurant. Our waiter was friendly and made some great recommendations. Stands out we're the crab toast, the mushroom pizza topped with egg, and the crispy pork confit. The dishes are prepared simply yet the flavors are complex. The vegetables are seasonal and really shine through even while playing background characters. Organic, local farm to table, free range, cruelty free, GMO free...you know you're in good hands. On a side note I found the crab toast recipe in an issue of Bon Appetit magazine. It is very simple to prepare and I have been making it for dinner parties ever since."
Chloe S.,"Manhattan, NY",7/22/2016,5 star rating,"ABC hands down is one of my favorite places for lunch for me and my girlfriends.   The crab toast is awesome and the kale salad there is fantastic.   What makes it great is the service, the food and the atmosphere.  the furniture looks like it was lifted straight out of the ABC carpet!   I actually bought my cups there because I enjoyed using them so much.Super fantastic."
Danisbel C.,"Miami, FL",12/6/2016,5 star rating,"One of my favorite all time restaurants!! Cannot wait till they open one here in Miami. I went to ABC kitchen 2 years ago now in February. I must go back on my next trip to NYC!! I recommend all my family and friends to go every time they are in NYC!!The service was outstanding and the food oh so good. From the fried chicken to the ricotta ravioli and even their burger is great. The desserts are amazing !!! The decor is also to die for, so simple yet elegant and modern. ABC kitchen is always a great idea!!"
Alli H.,"New York, NY",11/22/2015,4 star rating,"Really great dining experience.It's fun that you can see into ABC Home from the restaurant. I generally don't buy into the hype of restaurants (it's all up to your tastebuds). We just had a really pleasant experience, staff was nice and friendly. The food was solid.I wouldn't go back anytime too soon but I would consider going back."
Ro R.,"Brooklyn, NY",10/10/2013,3 star rating,"I have never wanted to come here due to the lack of interest of the menu during the times I checked.It was only recently their menu has appealed to me, unfortunately they had no reservations during the time when I was loving their menu.I got a reservations for a new menu, less interesting, but good enough for me to try this place out.I never knew how booked this place was, because seriously is this place this popular?I want to say the ambiance and the decor looks totally different from the outside. You would not expect this magical and alluring atmosphere.I love the chandeliers, the lighting, the petite flowers that decorated each of the tables. Lovely.We shared the line caught tuna sashimi - four pieces! The first piece, I didn't get much of the sauce on the first piece, but the second piece, I drizzle the sauce on top and it was much better. I love this sauce, it was spicy and full of flavour. H complained about the teaser and thought the pieces were a joke.H got the Grilled Salmon - I tried it and I still do not care for cooked salmon, it is too fishy.I got the Halibut - it also had a nice kick and was perfectly cooked.H got the cake, it was a bit dry - I didn't really care for the taste.I got the Apple Dumpling - it was decent, but there wasn't really anything else on the menu that I wanted.Overall, I enjoyed my fish, but the decor was better than the food.Also, my ginger margarita - where was the ginger? I found the tequila though - really strong.This is why I don't understand why this place gets fully booked every night.I give this place a 3.5 starsThe waitress was really pushing their heirloom tomato dishes on us, I love tomato, but I am not going to go to a restaurant to eat tomatoes that are sliced up.I can do that at home, I like to eat dishes that I cannot make myself or the preparation is tedious and hard to make. Not tomatoes!"
Patricia S.,"New York, NY",1/2/2014,3 star rating,"OK ABC Kitchen, the food really is fresh and wonderful, but I was really turned off by your service. The timing and attention is all off. The waitress would refill the water glasses of half the table and ignore the other half... They switched servers mid-meal, but then he was nowhere to be found. We had to get up and ask another server for our check. Very strange, considering the price of the food and the reputation of Jean-George establishments. With that being said, let's discuss the food - every single thing was very delicious. Just as everyone who's been here has told you. I highly recommend the kabocha squash toast, ricotta and dates pizza, brussel sprouts side, and the spaghetti.  I look forward to ABC Home Grown! Perhaps the service will be a tad better..."
Kevin C.,"Boston, MA",7/14/2017,5 star rating,"If I could give more stars I would give them , celebrated my birthday today and had an amazing time ! Food was amazing , had a cheese and charcuterie board, mushroom pizza, tenderloin special and for desert I had almond cake. EVERYTHING was delicious, can't even pick a favorite one.Great service, shoutout to Taylor, she's the busser but she definitely has the skills to be a server, felt really comfortable with her and she made my experience in the restaurant a lot better !"
Latef X.,"Los Angeles, CA",9/21/2014,3 star rating,"Actually 3.5 stars -- rounding down since it is fairly pricey.  Feel bad though cuz I had such a good time here though because I was in great company!!Crab toast and the cavatelli were the best dishes according to the overall consensus.  Everyone enjoyed the fried chicken as well.  I'd probably say skip the shroom pizza -- bottom was super soggy because they load on a TON of shrooms but super umami flavor.  The carrot salad that everyone raves about was good but not amazing.  Eggplant toast was meh.  Lots of vegetarian options which were all good, but none of the veggie dishes were mind blowing IMHO.  In my experience, farm to table, veggie dishes are best in SF Bay Area.  Sorry, NYC!Really beautiful venue with a good looking swanky crowd to match.  Service was pretty good, although it was kinda hard to find our actual server to get stuff sometimes.  He seemed really busy though, so all good.Getting reservations here is kinda insane -- you're probably not going to get a reso for a reasonable dinner hour unless you call the second the bookings open."
Alyssa G.,"Brooklyn, NY",7/7/2018,5 star rating,"Only been there once so far but there wasn't one thing I could find wrong. Food was delicious, service was fast and friendly. The reservation form online asked if it was for an occasion so we put in that we were going for our (9th!) anniversary. They gave us two mini cupcakes on a plate decorated with ""Happy Anniversary"" in chocolate sauce, which was super sweet and we honestly hadn't expected that. The decor is also really nice. Definitely want to go back and try more of what they've got! Highly recommend the crab toast appetizer & the mushroom-crusted salmon entree."
Nancy G.,"Sykesville, MD",5/13/2017,5 star rating,A lovely evening with a beautiful setting and amazing food. Very attentive service. Always nice when a restaurant is just as amazing as the last time.
Efraim S.,"Philadelphia, PA",7/29/2016,4 star rating,"Came here for restaurant week lunch with the girlfriend. We have been doing restaurant week for four years now and this was one of the better experiences. We loved the decor and the organized quirkiness of the space. The service was attentive and professional. In the past I have hate Jean Jorge restaurants (been to 4) as I find the portions too small, prices too high, and food unremarkable. I didn't feel that way at all about abc. The food was actually quite tasty and I left full. I was not amazed by any dish but I thought each dish had a nice flavor profile and was well cooked. The least satisfying course was the appetizers. The kale salad was rather underwhelming and the fluke though flavorful seemed below quality (stringy and tough). Crude should melt in your mouth. But the fish improved with the Salmon in a terrific carrot sauce and the portobello burger was full of flavor. My favorite course as usual was desert. The peaches were cooked beautifully and full of flavor.  The pistachio ice cream actually tasted like pistachios and complimented the peaches terrifically. I thought that the chocolate cake was very passable though I didn't get many bites as my gf gobbled it all up. In sum it was a pleasant experience."
Gabrielle F.,"Brooklyn, NY",1/31/2019,3 star rating,"Came here for restaurant week. The ambience and the wait staff were absolutely lovely. However, the food didn't quite meet the mark. For prices so expensive and with many of the rave reviews I read I did have my hopes up but of course within reason. The coffee was decent but a little burnt. We ordered the bean soup and squash toast for appetizer - both were the best part of the meal. Neither was particularly incredible but both did offer an excellent balance of flavor and texture. For the main entree we ordered the chicken and spinach dish and the campanelle. The chicken was tender and delicious; the sauce that it sat on though was a bit too sour for my taste; and the spinach oddly enough had zero flavor - similarly to the campanelle. The campanelle was served looking like an orange squash glob and tasted up to expectation - no flavor, mushy and soggy pasta. For dessert we ordered the chocolate cake and the panna cotta. The chocolate cake was quite nice, though the burnt flavor from the torched marshmallow did overbear a few bites. The panna cotta frankly just tasted like spoiled milk; we could not eat more than a few bites.FYI don't get tricked by the menu as the spacing dooped us :( dessert is not included in the prefixe I had such high hopes for this place, especially as I instantly fell in love with the beautiful interior, but sadly I won't be coming back."
Melissa C.,"Bellevue, WA",11/25/2013,5 star rating,"I've been waiting for a long time to try this restaurant and it lived up to my high expectations. The restaurant was decorated beautifully and my friends were all in admiration. They also had a great playlist going which set a fun, upbeat ambiance. The hostess sat us at a round table for our party of 6 which let us converse easily.For appetizers, we shared the crab toast, avocado and carrot salad and glazed doughnuts. One friend emitted a loud ""oh my god!"" after biting into the crab toast. It was as good as I heard it was. I was also impressed by the carrots which were so much tastier than I thought possible. I enjoyed the lemon doughnut as well.I ordered the burger (Michelle Obama got this when she came to the restaurant). I liked that it wasn't ginormous like so many burgers in NY. The herbed mayo and pickled jalapenos really made this burger unique and delicious. My friend got the spinach and goat cheese omelette which she didn't like because the omelette was all egg yolk. It gave the omelette a strange consistency and taste that she wasn't used to. Everyone else liked their dishes though.Service was spectacular and our waitress was sweet and attentive. I'll definitely come here again if I can snag another reservation. Also for parties of more than 4, they require a credit card and it's $45 pp if you are a no-show."
Chloe G.,"New York, NY",4/4/2016,3 star rating,We were here for brunch. It was a rainy day. The dish is okay. American dish. There's no one particularly interested me. But the dish are decent and delight. Brownie bow tie pasta looks amazing. We will order next time. And I left my newly purchased cosmetics there and they kept it for me. Service +1
Roddi S.,"Shrewsbury, MA",5/29/2016,5 star rating,"My daughter graduated from the New School, near Union Square, mid-day on a Thursday. I had to find a place for a graduation luncheon for eight, within minimal walking distance, that had a menu to please palates that ranged from ""salt is the only spice you need"" to ""I'll try anything"" and gluten-free options for the two celiacs in the group. Impossible, right? Wrong. ABC Kitchen to the rescue.Initially, I called for reservations at one of ABCK's sister restaurants who couldn't fit our group in the required time frame. After hearing my ridiculous  needs, ABCK was recommended; I couldn't be happier with the choice.The staff went above and beyond to make my daughter's day special. Our waitress was well versed in the menu's gluten-free choices and took special care to place the appetizers my daughter and I could not eat at the other end of the table from us. We've been diagnosed for years and know what we can/can't eat so this wasn't necessary for us but I was very impressed with the extra effort. If you are new to gluten-free eating, and are nervous about eating out, know you will be in safe hands here.Now, the food! Family and friends lived up to my expectations with varied menu choices. The calamari appetizer was a favorite as was the sugar snap pea salad. For entrees we had the akaushi burger and various pastas, fish, and chicken. Everything was delicious and perfectly prepared. Special kudos to the kitchen and wait staff: All food was delivered simultaneously; too often with large groups at least one dish is left withering under a heat lamp. That was definitely not the case here. We were too stuffed to order dessert, but the staff still made my daughter a celebratory sorbet; attentive to the end, it was a gluten-free alternative to what they normally provide an honoree.I highly recommend both ABC Kitchen and their sister restaurants."
Kilandra B.,"New York, NY",10/30/2017,5 star rating,"The ambiance was great from the second you walk in, so I was hoping the food would be as well. It was! I ordered the caramel apple french toast and it was the best french toast of my life! The cheddar biscuits were also amazing (super flaky). The Ginger Margarita was small but good. Make reservations if you can. I will be back."

Linda M.,"Warwick, NY",11/20/2016,5 star rating,"I went with a party of six to ABC Kitchen.  From outside I thought is was a very small place but then you go inside and it just opens up. It's a beautiful space , perfect for a special evening. Candles and twinkly lights, the staff was delightful and very attentive.  We enjoyed everything we had, it was last month so I am sorry I can't remember each item, but we had vegetarian and meat eaters alike and everyone was happy. The sweetest part of our evening was that our waiter had over heard us mention it was my daughters birthday and they gave her a decadent little cake with a candle and ""happy birthday"" written in the loveliest handwriting . I would definitely recommend, and can't wait to go again"
Amal S.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",5/25/2018,2 star rating,I was super excited to try this place because of the review but was really disappointed. Hosts and servers seem a bit pretentious. The crab toast was good but the entrees weren't anything special. Portion sizes are small and place is generally overpriced. We were so disappointed with the food that we didn't even order dessert. Left the place feeling hungry due to the small portion sizes.
Julio I.,"New York, NY",11/15/2015,2 star rating,"Food Review only.Party of 6, Wednesday night 10pm.The time might have something to do with the food quality.1. Fried Chicken - Breast and thigh portion. Breast was extremely dry. Thigh was decent. The ""breading"" is more similar to the one at Perry Street. Lacy and crispy, however the crispiness wasn't consistent throughout the whole filet. Mildly spicy, no other flavors coming through except spice. 2. Pork Belly - sweet. The confit was one note, and the pork wasn't as tender. The overall dish tasted like one sweet mess. 3. Sea bass - they completely wrecked this one. We had to send it back to the kitchen. Overcooked, high on the spice again without any other flavor coming through. 4. Veal pasta - sweet. Like boyardee.5. Squash salad - this was one surprising dish. The mellow flavors of the squash worked really well with the hint of shaved cheese. Pleasant, refreshing, kind of different. 6. Roast carrot and avocado salad - the carrots were definitely packed with flavor and aromas, pretty great dish overall. The textural balance was there and the avocado and citrus cut through the sharpness of the carrots nicely. 7. sweet onion, prosciutto, arugula pizza - classic. never a miss. sweet and salty with textural components.Advice: stay clear from the entrees unless this was an off night. The highlights were definitely the appetizers which were more focused in flavor and texture and seemingly had great concepts driving each one. The entrees seemed more like practice, unrefined, and definitely disastrous technique wise. If I would go back, I would treat this as a tapas place and just order plates from the apps. So disappointing. I really wanted to like the place..."
Alexis K.,"New York, NY",6/14/2015,3 star rating,"Cute place to visit for a date or girls night. It has a bit of bridal style atmosphere which was bright and interesting. I've checked out all of pictures on yelp prior to my experience here and I was extremely curious about their fried chicken. I was not impressed with their fried chicken. It did have great crispy texture and soft meat inside but the condiment that comes along with did not really go well together. Perhaps, the chicken wasn't seasoned well enough that i was seeking for some taste but overall experience of that chicken was quite blend without the texture. Homemade ricotta, farm egg pizza and their crab toast were delicious. I would come back for these but not fried chicken."
Sol C.,"Encinitas, CA",6/28/2014,4 star rating,"Had a lovely lunch at ABC Kitchen. They have a nice prix fixe lunch for $32 - and best of all, not everyone at the table had to order it! So I went with that special - sweet pea soup, ricotta/egg raviolo with pork ragu, and the salted caramel sundae. The soup was okay but the other two courses were fantastic. The pasta dish was one jumbo sized ravioli stuffed with ricotta and a runny egg yoke - unbelievably good. The salted caramel sundae was also extraordinary - the ice cream itself was salted and then topped with hot fudge, caramel popcorn and peanuts.My mom did not order the prix fixe and instead tried the salmon sashimi toast and the mushroom egg pizza. Unexpectedly, the salmon toast was my favorite dish of the entire meal. Soft pieces of thinly sliced salmon over a scallion mayo type of condiment on crispy delicious sourdough toast! The pizza was a bit soggy and disappointing. Overall, nice experience!"

Pam W.,"Queens, NY",8/11/2016,4 star rating,"This is a review for their restaurant week lunch menu.First impression: Elegant and modern, farm-to-table atmosphere. Overall, the food is tasty with some hits in some places and misses in others. The service was less than stellar even though the place wasn't particularly busy with patrons because they were transitioning to their dinner menu. Our water always remained filled but the timing between courses took longer than expected, forcing us to twiddle or thumbs. It was a little difficult to flag down a waiter for the check after we finished and spent a while waiting for it. Even the guests who were seated next to us later in the afternoon ended up leaving earlier.We had a small complimentary bread basket to start with some olive oil and salt to accompany it. For appetizers, we had the shaved fluke and the tomato and raspberry gazpacho. The shaved fluke was delicious and bright tasting in the lemon, olive oil, and dill sauce. The gazpacho was good but I think I could have done without the raspberries. For the main course, we had the raviolo and the salmon. The raviolo was absolutely delicious with generous amounts of shredded parmesan. The egg in the middle was well cooked and the whole dish came together perfectly with the pork ragu. The salmon was served medium rare in a sweet and spicy carrot sauce. I generally do not like carrots but they were roasted perfectly and complemented the salmon well. The salmon was delicious and very tender but overall it felt like something was missing from this dish.Dessert was probably the most disappointing but I find dessert a little underwhelming at most restaurants. We got one of each of the desserts offered -- the chocolate cake and the roasted peaches with pistachio ice cream. The chocolate cake is great for any dessert lover who loves rich and decadent chocolate desserts because it was made with malted chocolate ganache and topped with a toasted marshmallow icing. The roasted peaches with the pistachio ice cream combination did not work for me. I love pistachio ice cream but it actually tasted too strongly of pistachio for me. The texture of the ice cream was closer to being soup or yogurt and not as creamy / airy as I would have expected. The roasted peaches were delicious but not enough to save the dessert.I think I might have enjoyed the restaurant more if I had tried their normal menu and not their restaurant week menu. Perhaps I will visit again and give them a better evaluation next time.Overall rating 3.5/5 rounded up to 4"
Joseph S.,"Los Angeles, CA",2/21/2016,2 star rating,"Wow... Expecting such incredible food and was so underwhelmed. It was good but nothing you couldn't make yourself for a hundredth of the cost.How everyone says the decor is so amazing!?? It's 90s Shabby Chic from Malibu.Not worth the wait, money or hype.Organic farm to table food is decades old and much better done elsewhere.Save your money."
Colleen Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",9/5/2013,5 star rating,"ATMOSPHERE: (5/5)Such a memorable dining experience. My friend made a reservation for Monday (labor day weekend) at 8:30pm and the place was packed. The atmosphere is very modern, when I walked in my first impression was that this place reminds me of crate and barrel or a hip ikea.FOOD: (4/5)my favorite was Mushroom Egg Pizza, I can see why some people aren't a fan because of the runny egg but lucky me! I love runny egg! I never had a pizza like this and ABC has SPOILED me... #CravingThisNowI also had the Avocado and Carrot Salad or the Roast Suckling Pig. I really like how tender the pig was with piece of glazed skin(?) and crispy bacon underneath that just really went well together. The salad was different, large spicy charred carrots with sprouts - this dish complimented the pig dish.For dessert, I ordered the caramel popcorn sundae which was a bit overwhelmingly sweet for me. I had a bit of my friends market strawberry which I regret not ordering for myself. The almond cake was so delightful.   SERVICE (5/5)Our server was the sweetest person. Their service was just way above  my expectations. The pizza was cut into the exact # of people dining at our table (5 people unless, they always cut it into 5 pieces). I split my salad and suckling pig, the plating was just impeccable... so ABC split the dishes for you and your dinner date and plate it beautifully for each plate. Bonus:Our table was right next to one of my favorite celebrities!! Which was an added bonus to our dining experience. TL;DR: Superb Service, Inviting Atmosphere, Egg Pizza and Celebrity spotting."
Diana K.,"Dallas, TX",9/8/2013,4 star rating,"What can I say about ABC Kitchen that hasn't already been said? Beautiful interior and a perfect venue for brunch. Although be warned, you can spend a pretty penny or two trying to get full here. The bill came out to about $200+ for our party of four... definitely didn't anticipate ordering that much; portions are small, so be wary of that. Everything was light and fresh, but I'd say the most memorable were the appetizers (we got the calamari, crab toast, and salmon toast).It doesn't really appeal to me as a place I'd go to for dinner, but never say ""never,"" right?In sum: I'd definitely return for brunch, but probably only if it was a special occasion."
Sophie S.,"New York, NY",2/9/2020,4 star rating,"ABC Kitchen was delicious! The menu has a lot of great and fresh options and we loved every dish that we got. It's also beautifully decorated inside. Many dishes seemed like they had weird combos of ingredients but everything worked really well together. The only reason ABC Kitchen loses a star is because, although it seemed as if there were tons of people working there, it took forever to get our waitress over to our table every time we needed to order or ask a question. We had this same issue aaron ABC Cocina, too. The dessert could also be skipped but was still fine"
Jenn X.,"New York, NY",10/18/2016,4 star rating,"Awwww yeahhh: the mushrooms, parmesan, oregano and farm egg pizza. $22? I'd argue that's it's worth it. And I'm pretty cheap. I would also, however, argue that you can find comparable-tasting house-made chicken and pork sausage (with pistachio, potatoes and wholegrain mustard) elsewhere--instead of paying $18 for it here. But hey, this is a swanky place and you can rest assured that even if you break the bank here, you won't regret what you ate or drank. I'm still dreaming about their $11 g joy, junmai ginjo genshu, oregon sake. ABC Kitchen is loud, and you may have trouble finding a seat, but that's for a reason. Thankfully, they've hired excellent staff who can help you navigate the restaurant and its menu."
Celine F.,"South River, NJ",2/21/2016,5 star rating,"Got a last minute reservation for lunch on a Friday. I was thrilled because we finally got the chance to sit in the main dining room. The waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and gave great input on our meal. We started off with cocktails, and I got a yummy clementine mojito -- soo refreshing. My BF got the burger, and I got the tuna sashimi and crab toast. The burger had thin slices of jalapeño which added a nice kick, however they were too spicy for BF. I gladly ate them for him! The freshly shaved cheese on the burger was delectable. The tuna was beyond fresh, and the crab toast was a great complimentary dish. Loved every bit of the meal. Of course we couldn't resist ordering the salted caramel sundae - no regrets. It was just as amazing as the first time we had it. I left with my appetite satiated, and not overly stuffed. Can't wait to return to try the famous prix fixe menu."
Ian M.,"La Jolla, CA",12/1/2018,4 star rating,One of my new favorite places in NYC for outstanding food and relaxed but fun atmosphere. Very farm & table style with some posh flare. Rumor is the solid distressed wood beams running around the ceiling are from an old ship!
Hannah G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",4/25/2018,5 star rating,"This is the kind of place where everyone is kind of famous, but not recognizably famous. Like you're probably going to see a D-list celebrity and not even know it. It's an awesome spot to bring people when they're visiting the city and the food is so good (mushroom, parm, farm egg pizza!!!). And to top it all off it's part of the behemoth ABC carpet and home and if a carpet store buying up city blocks and getting into fine dining isn't the American dream, I don't know what is."
Stephanie A.,"New York, NY",7/23/2014,5 star rating,"Wow, absolutely great. Good thing we came at 5:45 - or we may not had a table. Recommend reservations! Only two of us, so we were sat at a high top. Plus - bar is full service, you can always saddle up there and eat. Between two of us we shared the crab toast (must try), pretzel dusted calamari (just enough for two), and the diver scallop appetizer (excellent if you like dill and pepper ). All three were great to share and left us with room for dessert! Must get the salted caramel with peanut and popcorn sundae! I don't even like chocolate - but to truly appreciate this dessert you have to get all components in one spoon. So great!"
Debra R.,"Oceanport, NJ",11/18/2016,5 star rating,Love this place and the vibe here and the food is unique and wonderful. Everyone is always really nice too and helpful.
Jessie B.,"Gilbert, AZ",8/21/2016,5 star rating,"Popped in here for dinner the other night (yes I will be back for restaurant week)! Love this place although it's a bit pricey the food is amazing and so is the staff. Perfect location tucked in behind Union Square too. A ton of vegetarian options plus local, organic and seasonal eats, YES PLEASE!Fettuccine with pesto, tomatoes, wax beans was delicious, fresh, light and flavorful and perfectly portioned.Crab toast appetizer was delicious also and perfect to share.They have an amazing wine list as well as some pretty cocktails, the Melon Daiquiri is delicious and refreshing not too sweet.Their menu is amazing im talking lobster, fish, flatbread pizzas, pastas everything a foodie could dream of plus the ambiance and the staff are not stuffy at all."
Franny A.,"New York, NY",10/14/2013,3 star rating,"Professional, orchestrated service- OVERpriced food albeit local sustainable blah blah blah......you always leave unsatisfied. Been here for both lunch and dinner in the last week. Dinner- shared salad with goat cheese and spicy balsamic was amazing. Diver scallops were also very good. Each app. is about $15- yikes.Lunchtime- came for the donut, I saw at dinner and didn't have. While the bakery boys said they had donuts, the waiter said only at dinner.I ordered a hot chocolate- stellar and turkey sandwich with bacon- while the sandwich was good- the thinly sliced turkey was a turnoff- where's the texture George? Oh and most importantly- where's the value? Smells and feels like a tourist trap!"
Sunflower L.,"New York, NY",1/4/2018,5 star rating,"One of my favorite restaurant in NYC. Even i caught cold. I still think the food is delicious. I had the crispy pork. It is great.  Will come back here again soon and try other dishes. btw, ice-cream is good enough for 2."
Hiroko M.,"Bellingham, WA",6/10/2016,4 star rating,I had carrot and avocado salad and crab toast. They were good. The service was excellent as well.
Keeley G.,"New York, NY",5/24/2018,3 star rating,"Went here on a Tuesday night around 7, it was pretty packed. We put our name down for 2 and were told it was about a 20 min wait. We waited outside but after 20 mins decided to go in and wait at the bar. A young man took a drink order but almost 15 mins later we still had no drink. He was clearly a barback and couldn't serve but was going to pass the order along to one of the bartenders. When we saw him again and asked how the drinks were coming he didn't even recognize us. Understandable as it was packed but now we've got no drinks and no table 35 mins later. They resurrected the situation by grabbing a bartender who quickly made our drinks then graciously offered to comp them. We decided to order food at the bar, and as our first dish came the host told us our table was ready, 50 mins later. We just decided to stay at the bar. The drinks were good, as was the food but I wouldn't say spectacular. The ambiance is enjoyable and the bartender who ended up serving us was nice but I would say overall this was average and not worth the hype. Also having worked as a host, it really pays off to know your dining room and your patrons to better estimate wait time and keep everyone happy."
Lauren W.,"North Miami Beach, FL",5/4/2018,5 star rating,This restaurant was trendy and had a fantastic atmosphere. Everything ordered at our table was delicious. A little expensive but worth it. Would recommend others to give it a try!
Lauren T.,"New York, NY",8/26/2015,5 star rating,"Made lunch reservations at 12:15PM and by 12:45, the restaurant was fairy filled for a Monday afternoon. I would describe this place as farm to table fine casual modern American. The restaurant is spacious and very well decorated. Before we sat, I already knew I was going to like my experience, perfectly dim lighting and friendly floor staff. For appetizers I would definitely recommend the crab aioli toast because it was seasoned beautifully. We also shared the tuna sashimi drowned in a succulent ginger sauce. And to continue my seafood extravaganza, I ordered the black sea bass with herbes and chile with a bed of tomatoes and greens. Everything was light, refreshing, and well crafted. The chef knows how to enhance the beauty and taste of simple foods. The prices were a bit $$$ but if you have it, spend it here. You're guaranteed a modern not at all snobby NYC dining experience. Even their bread and olive oil taste good here! *Note that the portions are on the lighter end so I would recommend to get an appetizer and entree."
Lawrence F.,"Manhattan, NY",3/4/2015,2 star rating,"They stuff this place with people. The roof is high and creates a facade of spaciousness. But sit down and it's another story. I came here with my sister a few days ago and we were placed on a two person table - one of about 8 aligned in a cafeteria like row. There was about a foot between each table. Twice it happened where our neighboring table joked with us about how close we were together. In all seriousness though, it made hearing the waiters and waitresses difficult, and conversation strenuous. I ordered a white aphro,  which carried an old, stale aftertaste. After that, I went with an SH double white that was much better. The draft choices were very limited. My sister got the chardonnay,  which she seem satisfied with. Before I get to the food, I'd like to mention that I had to ask for their complementary bread rolls three times before they actually arrived. A bummer given that the entree came at that time as well, and my sister had long since drank her progressively chilling pumpkin soup. For food, my sister made the right choice and went with the Ravioli. I tried it and boy was it tasty. My veal meatballs and pasta left me a bit disappointed. The meat was tender and flavorsome, but the sauce on the pasta was bland and bitter. Overall, I wouldn't say don't go here, but if you do, hede my word, make it known early on that you deserve their complementary bread."
Sabastian F.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",3/13/2020,5 star rating,"Great great great , the servers , food ,atmosphere, also prices are good for quality you receive , used to go 2 times of month for 3 yrs , but so many new places opened , but this place is still special"
Amirah A.,"Los Angeles, CA",12/28/2017,3 star rating,"I was really excited about this restaurant. My finance and I came here for Christmas dinner while vacationing in the big Apple. The best part of ABC Kitchen is the decor inside. You would think you're transported to a winter wonderland. Very beautiful space, so I may come back for dessert or drinks. During the night we had 2 waitresses. The first waitress had terrible attitude while our second waitress was very sweet. The food was just OK. We started off with the kale salad which my fiancé liked but I couldn't finish. Which is odd considering I love kale. The chili's were too spicy for me and I wasn't a huge fan of how much lemon was in it. For our entrees, hubby ordered the burger while I opted for the half portion of pesto fettuccine. The pasta was good, very warm and rich sauce. Probably my favorite of the night but again nothing that was WOW. Same goes for hubby's burger, which according to our waitress is Top 5 in Manhattan. The burger was a bit spicy in my opinion. We skipped dessert and ordered wine instead to enjoy the actual presence of the restaurant which again is quite lovely."
Joey X.,"San Francisco, CA",12/28/2013,3 star rating,"3.5 starsI've heard so many good things about ABC Kitchen, and read so often of its amazingness, that when I finally visited it was a bit of a disappointment...I came here with my family this past Christmas Eve. We ordered for 8 so tried most of the items on the menu:- Crab toast: not mind-blowing but quite delicious- Homemade ricotta, cranberry compost and bread: ricotta was good (comparable to Laconda Verde's ricotta app), but small proportion- Kasha and bowtie pasta: veal meatballs were good, recommended- Ricotta raviola: not memorable- Whole wheat pasta with ricotta, prosciutto and dates: meh- Black sea bass: recommended- wood-fired Maine lobster: one lobster cut in half, recommended- Fried organic chicken: recommended (brings to mind fried chicken schnitzel)- Pork confit (seasonal item): very rich- brussel sprouts: mehFor desert, the fruit plate was a total letdown (super small) and the assorted doughnuts, which were really good.Overall - decent meal, but no way as good as people say. Most of the dishes weren't super memorable and I much prefer Gramercy Tavern two blocks away."
Anna Z.,"New York, NY",9/14/2014,5 star rating,This definitely made the top 5 places I have ever eaten at. (I tried both mine and my dates food)The Food: 1. Pretzel Crusted Calamari - Perfect balance of the crunchy texture from the pretzels to the soft/tender texture of the fresh calamari I just don't understand why other restaurants are not frying their calamari in crushed pretzels. 2. Raw Scallops on the shell - They were so sweet and honestly melted in your mouth. This was by far my FAVORITE dish. 3. The Suckling Pig - Well this had bacon marmalade on top of it...Need I say more? 4. Fried chicken in hot butter sauce - You honestly can't go wrong with fried chicken and butter and this was so juicy and buttery that it was just amazing! The service was impeccable and the decor was perfectly trendy and romantic. In my opinion everyone needs to come here at least once. I for sure want to come back so I can try the dessert in addition to other menu items.So DELICIOUS!
Jessica K.,"New York, NY",6/12/2016,5 star rating,"By far my favorite restaurant hands down! I've never been disappointed by any restaurant by Jean-Georges and this one speaks for itself. The deco is chic, simple yet modern. The customer service here was great, and the food was superb. I sure will be coming back for more!"
Shruti K.,"Brooklyn, NY",9/30/2015,3 star rating,I love this restaurant more for it's decor than the food. Have eaten here on several occasions and the food is good but not the best. The whole wheat pizza is scrumptious. I prefer the tomato mozzarella over the mushroom. From the flavors you can't tell it's a whole wheat crust. Everything else I've eaten is average. The fried calamari not so crispy. The deserts are great and good portion sizes. The ice cream is a tad bit eggy! I don't like that after taste. Love love the chocolate cake and the sundae. The addition of popcorn is scrumptious. The almond cake in itself is good. The accompanying compote is very tart.Their newer restaurant ABC Cocina is much much nicer & my favorite place to go now.
Julie Y.,"New York, NY",1/16/2016,5 star rating,"What can I say that hasn't been said? Everything was 5 stars - the food, the ambience and service.I can't wait to try ABC cocina"
Nicole E.,"San Francisco, CA",6/28/2014,5 star rating,Each & every single time I come here it's as good as the last if not better!The food is simply flavoursome & delicious. Our server swayed us for the salmon sashimi toast as a starter & wow wow wow...it was delicious! It even tasted way more delicious than it looked. All thanks to the snow pea remoulade hiding beneath the salmon. The toasted bread underneath was smoky. & delicious too.Next we had the red snapper & the fried chicken. I'm not a huge fan of fried chicken as it's not the healthiest option but when done well I can't refuse...& at abc kitchen it's done so lightly in a gorgeous butter sauce (sounds bad but it was light & tangy & not swimming in the sauce). Definitely a big portion & balanced out the slightly smaller portion of snapper. The snapper was perfectly cooked sitting on a bed of steamed spinach broth with a hint of some kind of fruit chutney & minimal chilli. When teamed together it was light & fragrant. We couldn't possibly fit in dessert but the lime basil daiquiri is not to be missed. #alwaysdelicious
Allan R.,"Baltimore, MD",5/30/2016,5 star rating,"EPIC.  Another incredible nyc meal. Decor was classic abc home: Beautiful with class.  The menu was superb, the staff exceptional and the food was superb. A must !  Probably our family regular new spot. Try the fluke, crab toast and no matter what direction you go for dinner, you can't go wrong!"
Brielle B.,"Manhattan, NY",9/7/2016,5 star rating,"Tucked away underneath ABC Home, this place is a gem. From the outside, it doesn't look like much, but open the door, order a Bloody Mary (THE best I've had, hands down. And that's saying something), and enjoy the ambiance. The menu prices are steep, but worth it. Get the fluke appetizer and ask for bread and olive oil (sometimes the servers don't bring it automatically). The turkey sandwich might not seem like much, but it is incredible, and easy to split with a friend. It brings along some tasty fries as well.I've been for brunch and dinner, and every time I have been there, it has been packed. I do not think you can make reservations, so make sure your whole party gets there at once. While you wait, keep an eye out for seats opening up at the bar. It's full service, and often much quicker than waiting for a table."
Kevin S.,"New York, NY",12/15/2015,4 star rating,I've heard a lot of  good things about this restaurant. I decided to celebrate her my birthday. The food was very delicious and fresh look nice. I ordered risotto and oysters.I am delighted! I was expecting a lot from this restaurant and I was not disappointed.
Liz M.,"Medfield, MA",7/24/2018,5 star rating,The food and atmosphere we're both outstanding. My fish was cooked perfectly and the flavors of all of our dishes were so fresh. Both of us we're totally obsessed with the crab toast appetizer and the simple side of peas and carrots. I have never asked a restaurant for a new table placement but the first table we sat at was in a high traffic area. The hostess was gracious and professional in reseating us at a quieter location.
Denise J.,"Manhattan, NY",9/13/2015,5 star rating,"Everyone loved their ABC's growing up. This was always a big deal. As an adult now, it still seems to be a big deal. My boyfriend came from Chicago to New York for the first time, and said ""wow me."" I said, ""we both know I'm good for that."" Comes dinner time, and at ten thirty we managed to still have no reservation. I made a res on OpenTable for eleven and voilà !! There it was, super easy. We were greeted at the door by a friendly set of host, one of which walked us to table 54. The table is located in the middle of the dinning room towards the wall, which allowed us to take in the fabulous decor. My boyfriend loved the food! It was a bit late for me to eat, but we returned that Saturday for brunch !!! Oh, I love me some brunch! Everything was fantastic. Needless to say my boyfriend wants to return again.  Oh well Denise girl, slow down! What'd you have?That's a great question! Besides waffles and French toast, I am a die-hard fan of fried calamari! Hence we indulged in pretzel dusted calamari as an app. And of course crab toast with lemon aioli. YUM! For my guac lovers ! Someone said avocado ?! Then the roasted carrots and avocado salad is totes for you. I took this to go. It was very good. As for brunch, French toast with vanilla poached pears was everything and a day. Service, food, and ambiance was impeccable."
Hieu T.,"Houston, TX",12/13/2015,4 star rating,"The food was on point and everything was pretty delicious. The fried chicken was raved about by friends and I thought it was just ok. The service kinda sucked though. It took so long for our fried chicken to come out, I almost cancelled it but i really wanted to try it. I had to tell 2 different waiters to ask where it was because it literally was 40 minutes after the dish before it when it came out. They ended up comping the chicken off the bill so that semi made up for the slow service. Place is cool though and a nice atmosphere. There were other things I wanted to try on the menu but didnt have enough room in my stomach. Maybe next time I will go with a couple more people and try more dishes"
K R.,"New York, NY",5/27/2018,2 star rating,"Sadly, I was super disappointed in ABC Kitchen, especially since I had been anticipating eating here after hearing such great things. Plus, you need to make a reservation here a few weeks in advance, so I thought it would at least be worth the hype!Portions are small and overpriced. The kale salad was measly, flavorless, and not worth the $17 or so. Honestly, the kale salad in any Dig Inn, Sweetgreen, etc is better than the salad here. Ordered the margharita pizza and burger as well, and both were small portions and meh in general. 2 stars for the wonderful service and cocktails. Service was on point the entire night and they all had a great, friendly attitude. But sadly, Id return for the food, not the service! Skip ABC Kitchen and try something else for your date night!"
Shilpa P.,"Indianapolis, IN",6/18/2017,5 star rating,"So pretty much I was blown away by this restaurant. I had been wanting to try ABC Kitchen for such a long time but you have to make a reservation early enough to get a table. After a few unsuccessful attempts at securing a reservation, I made it my mission to go to ABC Kitchen for my post-graduation lunch. The earliest you can book a table online on Open Table is 1 month before the actual reservation so I waited until midnight exactly one month before the day I wanted to have my graduation lunch, and then I successfully reserved a table for 8. I was ecstatic. Finally the day that I get to experience ABC Kitchen comes. As soon as I walked in I was amazed. The decor is so pretty with its beautiful light fixtures and flower arrangements, and the space is quite large. I would say the decor of ABC Kitchen is similar to that of Anthropologie so if you like the way Anthropologie looks you will definitely like this restaurant's layout. Now for the food. I was incredibly impressed. Being a party of 8, I was able to try many dishes including the roasted beets with housemade yogurt, crab toast with lemon aioli (OH MY GOSH TOO GOOD), spring pea soup with carrots and mint, pretzel dusted calamari, roasted portobello and celery leaves, housemade ricotta ravioli, akaushi cheeseburger with herbed mayo and pickled jalapenos, a side of the roasted asparagus, and the salted caramel ice cream sundae. I loved everything I had. Usually when I eat out there's at least one dish that isn't that stand out but not in this case. The one dish that I was absolutely in love with was the crab toast.  The crab was so fresh and had an excellent taste to it. My table of 8 ended up ordering two more orders of it, and I ended up eating about 2/3 of those extra orders. No regrets. I was also a huge fan of the roasted beets with housemade yogurt and the roasted portobello. But again everything was good. As for dessert, the salted caramel sundae surely did not disappoint especially with popcorn being in it. Similar to the food, the service was on point. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. My graduation ended earlier that I thought it would so I called ABC Kitchen asking if there was any way I could bump up my reservation an hour. I was expecting a ""no"" knowing how busy they are, but they were able to bump us up 30 minutes which was awesome.  In addition, even though we ordered many dishes and drinks being a large party, the service was quick and no mistakes were made.Since one of my family members told our waitress that I had graduated that day, our waitress brought me a very cute mini cupcake and wrote congratulations with chocolate fudge on the plate. Not only was the cupcake cute but that was also delicious.Overall, I was delighted with my experience, and even though my expectations of ABC Kitchen were already high, my expectations were exceeded. I definitely plan on coming back multiple times...as long as I book ahead of time."
Da C.,"Long Beach, CA",1/27/2016,5 star rating,Two words: crab toast Love this place! Beautiful inside. Great for dinner dates. Reservations are hard to come by so reserve ahead of time. Large restaurant so great for large parties too.
Saki B.,"Stamford, CT",11/21/2015,1 star rating,"SOOOOO AVERAGE and overpriced. So if you are a left over of the Yuppy era and can't tell that your over 20usd shrimp salad is out of a bag (because if it wasn't, I advise they should use one- TraderJoes is great guys), then this place is the bomb. Go here. Sit on the pulled felt bar stools circa 2005. Service was great but Guys the food was laughable"
Phoebe W.,"The Strip, Las Vegas, NV",1/29/2017,4 star rating,love the ambience of this restaurant. Service is good but the food is just okay and not amazing. need to put more effort on the presentation of their food. I ordered crispy pork confit. Love the bacon and onion source.
Callie R.,"Atlanta, GA",2/28/2019,5 star rating,"This is again one of my favorite spots in the big apple! I love the organic ingredients and fresh flavors of the food. It's unique and welcome in a place where processed foods have generally become the norm. If you're in the area, ABC Kitchen is definitely a worthwhile stop for lunch or dinner. Highly, highly recommend!"
Tom W.,"San Francisco, CA",1/27/2016,3 star rating,"Went there after much hype, and was thoroughly whelmed.  the food was fairly tasty but expensive for the quality, brussel sprouts were thoroughly and hopefully unintentionally burned, the fried chicken tasty but way inferior to root and bone, and the vibe hopelessly crowded and scenestery for such a large place.  You can't combine huge restaurant with crowded and pushy.  Beets were outstanding, service pleasant and polite (a whole bunch of models in flannel and thick rimmed warby parkers)."
June Y.,"New York, NY",8/19/2014,5 star rating,"I had the best brunch experience of my life here. I could instantly see why people were raving about it. The place is so spacious, clean, and very well decorated. All the waiters were well dressed and very attentive.As for the food, I strongly strongly recommend the french toast. It's so creamy on the inside (could not believe that it's bread) and slightly crunchy on the outside, covered in cinnamon and sugar. The syrup comes in a cute beaker but is rarely needed because the toast itself is unbelievably sweet and delicious.I definitely want to come back and see what other yummy options they offer."
Tiffany L.,"San Francisco, CA",5/17/2014,4 star rating,"Was told that this was a MUST while in NYC. Loved their Decor and service.We started with house cut fries. They were perfectly seasoned and hot.We shared the fried chicken and mushroom pizza. The fried chicken's batter was very light and flaky. I prefer a light batter and because it was flaky, it wasn't drenched in oil. The chicken was very tender and juicy. The pizza crust was thin and chewy. I wished the farm egg was cooked a little more. It was hard to capture the yolk since it was quite runny.Is recommend sharing and saving broom for dessert. There was quite some interesting options but unfortunately we didn't have enough room."
Michelle W.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",12/10/2015,4 star rating,"ABC Kitchen is the popular farm-to-table concept in Jean-Georges Vongerichten's empire. It's surprisingly hard to get a prime time reservation here even months in advance so do plan ahead if you want to visit. Otherwise I've also had luck last minute.First things first - I love the inside of this restaurant and the space is surprisingly bigger than it looks from the outside. There's a bar / standing area when you first walk in, followed by the dining room, then a space in the back with an upstairs (never sat in this area). The design is what I can only describe as rustic-chic (is that a thing?) - the wooden tables and wildflowers are balanced by elegant chandeliers and glassware.While the food is always solid, I don't think I've ever been blown away. The pizzas are always a highlight (especially the mushroom one!), but the pastas fall short compared to other true Italian joints in the city. The entrees are good but again - nothing that has stood out and made me reminisce weeks later. A plus in my books is that if you like to order family style, they'll split portions for you in the kitchen and bring out 2 half-portion plates for you."
Judy L.,"Brooklyn, NY",6/30/2018,4 star rating,Nice place overall.  The mushroom pizza is a must.  Definitely make ressie a or you will end up at the bar area.   A bit pricey for casual dinner but ok for special occasion.
Samuel M.,"Manhattan, NY",8/15/2015,1 star rating,"Oh deception, waiting so much for this? The service was rushed, th food was bad, you can eat better anywhere. A disaster.  We were excited to try the popular and famous ABC Kitchen. We've been to ABC Cocina and it was way better. The plates were tiny, the flavors and quality of the fish a blow. The crowd isn't the trendiest... The hosts neither. The only thing i liked  were the black and white photographs in the walls.   Very hard place to get a reservation and a total failure."
Jeff D.,"Cleveland, OH",11/19/2013,4 star rating,"Excellent interestingly prepared foods in a ""shabby chic"" environment. Started with the roasted carrot and avocado salad and it was spicy delicious. Enjoyed the bow tie pasta with veal meatballs and the grape tart (when was the last time you saw a grape dessert on a menu?) was a pleasant surprise. All in all a good experience. Odd reservation process though. I call for a reservation after Open Table said they were full and nothing was available. I walked into an emptying dining room near the end of serving hours? A great way to keep people away! Glad I stopped in!"
Ron J.,"Del Monte Forest, CA",2/10/2018,5 star rating,I can't say enough about ABC Kitchen. AWESOME!!! love this place. We've spent an absolute fortune between ABC Kitchen and Cucina - worth every dollar. In all the years I've eaten there I only had to send back one dish. ABC Kitchen is my most favorite restaurant in NYC.
Dannie D.,"Manhattan, NY",8/4/2016,3 star rating,"I've always been curious about this place that seems to always comes up on whatever list of restaurants to try in NYC. Finally I had a chance to check it out and was left rather disappointed. We had a late reservation at 10 PM so perhaps this was the cause for lackluster service service and food execution. We shared a salad and had linguine and mushroom pizza for entrees. To me, everything was very salty although my companion thought it was fine. Overall, the menu and food itself are just okay. The peach panna cotta dessert was amazing though. The decor is cute but it was a bit overwhelming being in a massive room with lots of tables and people and noise."
Shary E.,"Chicago, IL",5/22/2018,5 star rating,"Food was amazing!  Had an incredible Tuna Sashimi style appetizer that all of us raved about!  Everything was terrific, but that was standout incredible!  When I'm in NY I will definitely be back. We sat at the bar, but I recommend the dining room as it is so beautiful!"
Kat V.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",6/22/2015,5 star rating,"My friends ands I have been dying to come to ABC Kitchen for the longest time. But the restaurants popularity and our desire to have dinner BEFORE 9:00PM made it difficult... However, after weeks of occasional checking, we were able to snag a Monday night reservation for 6! Score!Food was great - favourites of the night included: the crab toast, pork confit, mushroom pizza, caramel popcorn sundae, and the cheesecake cookie on the cookie plate. Phenomal meal! A little pricey but well worth it. I love, love, loved the ambience and decor. The rustic feel of the exposed wood beam ceilings with an elegant yet modern and simple table setting was a real winner for me!Service was great too - ALL of the staff were helpful, professional, and very friendly!"
Jen L.,"San Francisco, CA",3/27/2016,5 star rating,"Amazing. In the words of my boyfriend, ""the crab toast is fucking stellar"". Decor is rustic, modern chic though I do prefer ABC Cocina's style better. Still, had a great culinary experience. Starting with the famous crab toast with lemon aioli which tasted fresh and super flavorful. Then, I got the red snapper while my boyfriend got the halibut. Both fishes were super tasty and the side of fries perfectly complemented as well. For dessert, we got the sundae which was pretty unique with salted caramel popcorn and was delicious. Definitely want to come back here again to try the pizzas and pastas that are supposed to be really good as well."
Aviva M.,"Lake Hopatcong, NJ",11/7/2018,5 star rating,"Oh my god! AMAZING! Four of us came here for a work lunch, and we all agreed it was one of the best meals we've had. The service - impeccable. The food - delicious. I had the butternut squash campanelle and it was AMAZING! Like the Fettuccini Alfredo we all want - without the sickening heavy feeling. One of the best pastas I've ever had. My friend had the ravioli which was one of the best ravioli she ever had. We both got the smaller portion and regretted it. The more, the better. Then we ordered all the desserts (except for the fruit plate). The popcorn sundae was our first choice. Salty, sweet, perfect. The chocolate cake was delicious but too rich for most of us. The cookie plate was solid. All in all, we had an amazing time and we can't wait to come back."
Rebecca G.,"New York, NY",2/27/2018,4 star rating,"I was so excited to try this place for the first time but my cheap Bumble date wouldn't take me past the bar on a first date, I on an empty stomach at the suggestion of ABC Kitchen, the smell of delicious food coming out was so overwhelming I had to leave him $hort, just like him. So all I can say is the water was great, the atmosphere too, and I'LL BE BACK with another star"
Wendy V.,"Denver, CO",2/25/2018,5 star rating,This is this by far is the best brunch I've ever had. everything is amazing from the carrots ginger martini to the crab toast to the salmon to the avocado to the salted caramel with the popcorn.  The decor is amazing the food is life-changing the place is the cutest place ever in Manhattan you must try it. The pancakes are also very good with a crisp edge and a custard that is so creamy. I want to go there every day. The people watching is also great. Well worth every penny
Victoria L.,"Philadelphia, PA",11/10/2015,5 star rating,"With reservations at 11am, my friend and I were greeted with a line halfway to the corner because the restaurant doesn't open until 11 on the dot. Once let in, we were quickly led to our seats. Pictures don't do the space justice; it's beautiful with lots of rustic wooden pieces contrasted with metallic accents. We started with some cocktails; my friend ordered a green apple mimosa while I got the ginger margarita. They were perfect morning cocktails with fresh and fragrant flavors. As an appetizer, we ordered the crab toast. Then I decided on the highly-raved roasted carrot and avocado salad, and she got the mushroom egg pizza. The roasted carrots were among the best of the vegetable I've tasted, and the dressing was a crisp citrusy vinaigrette that perfectly cut the creamy avocado. I had a bite of my friend's pizza, which was very rich with a béchamel cheese sauce on it, but the mushrooms tasted so fresh! Unfortunately our crab toast didn't come until the middle of our meal. Luckily I got a salad and was able to enjoy (though my friend was stuffed from her pizza and only had 1 piece). The cool crab and lemon aioli were a perfect flavor combination. All of the bread - the crab toast, the complimentary bread basket, and my salad croutons - were all incredible and very flavorful."
Katie I.,"Nashville, TN",4/2/2014,5 star rating,"Wow. Yes. Hell Yeah. Probably the most memorable meal I've had. I was super stoked to have gotten reservations via open table for lunch. I made them way in advance to ensure a spot during our NYC visit. Walking in was like walking into a magical wooded fairyland. The décor is unlike anything I've seen. Rustic, chic, modern, romantic. It feels almost fancy, but without the feeling of pretentiousness you see at other ""happening"" places. Our server was friendly and helpful. Started off with the carrot and avocado salad which was simply magnificent. We told them we'd be sharing, so they took the liberty of splitting our dish, which was appreciated. So many textures and flavors going on. This is a must order!We also split the Akaushi Burger. The freshest, juiciest piece of meat I think I've experienced in a burger. Bun was divine. Pickled jalepenos? Yes, I think I'll bathe in them. Homemade fries cooked to perfection and didn't resemble any grease or over salting like every other restaurant. Delish.The Salted Caramel Ice Cream sundae with popcorn and roasted peanuts. Wow. Rich, decadent, the salted caramel ice cream was the perfect, cool compliment to the richness of the sauce. What an amazing dessert. Not to be missed. I had forgotten when I made reservations I noted ""Birthday"" in special comments, as it was my husband's belated birthday lunch. The server came out with small homemade chocolate cupcake with ""happy birthday"" written in chocolate on the plate along with a candle. What a nice surprise. Service was perfection throughout the meal. Waters filled, not overly annoying, wiped crumbs off the table in between courses, changed out the silverware, folded up my napkin when I went to the restroom. The mismatched plaid shirts the servers wore added a casual, hipster feel amongst the elegant, yet rustic ambience. I was like a kid in a candy store just staring at each table with mismatched china, kitchen towels as napkins, reclaimed wooden tables mixed with modern pieces. The unexpected light features, glass shelved wall, the fresh flowers all added such elegance to the experience, but the menus clipped to cardboard added a flair of whimsy. I was surprised to see how reasonably priced it was, too. Especially when a place of this caliber prides themselves on local and organic ingredients. What a tremendous value. Caught a glimpse of Chef Dan Kluger as he went to say hello to what appeared to be Idina Menzel dining behind us. This is a place not to be missed. Well done, Jean Georges. Well done."
Anita L.,"New York, NY",12/17/2017,4 star rating,"This place is decorated beautifully reminiscent of it's eponymous partner store with modern yet ornate fittings and a character all it's own.  The food is fresh and being farm-to-table locally sourced with what's currently in season.  Starting with a good sized portion of cured meat and local cheese along with the crab toast (which was an excellent choice) to share along with wine, I then had the black sea bass dish with chilies and herbs etc. for my main.  I thought the dish was executed well but it wasn't amazing - the fish was cooked to perfection but felt the chili flavor may have been a little overpowering for this type of fish.  My friend had the pork confit which was easily the standout dish that night, moist and tender with well thought out flavors, exceptional! Finished with almond cake and another dessert which I can't recall."
Xavier M.,"CA, CA",11/23/2015,2 star rating,"So we went to this restaurant for our anniversary. I will separate my review on what I like and what I think can be improved. We ordered 1 main dish each plus a side of Brussels sprouts. Good: We had a reservation for 9pm and they sat as at 9pm. I don't know if they are able to schedule reservations down to the minute, but I was impressed. The service was good and caring. The pork confit was good.To be improved: Like most restaurants in NYC, there is not enough light and the room was incredible noisy. For a meal consisting of 2 entrées, one dessert and tap water we paid more than 100$ plus tipping. My gf's dish was some fish on spicy sauce with potatoes and I wasn't convinced. The same goes for the seasonal doughnuts.Overall, I feel that over 100$ for two people for what we ate without any drinks is too much"
Stephanie Q.,"New York, NY",6/12/2013,4 star rating,"A-ll organicB-y Jean GeorgesC-ool decor (I think there is a furniture shop in the restaurant too?)KitchenAs stated above, the food here is organic, and it was delicious. We started off with bread and olive oil.I had the eggs benedict with fried potatoes, and it was absolutely delicious. It was slightly pricey but for the quality of food i was getting, it was worth it. The ham came from the Flying Pig Farm, which is in New York, and no, the pigs do not fly since they are subject to more gravitational force. I was so intrigued by the name that I looked up the Flying Pig Farm and you can even stay on the farm for a night!"
Wisam C.,"Boston, MA",1/18/2016,2 star rating,"A - ambianceB - serviceC - foodThey don't serve fried chicken anymore. So for those who are going for it by reading reviews, DONT. The margarita/cheese pizza at 7 eleven is far better than what they serve. The pan seared chicken was tasteless. The ""fresh lemonade"" was sour that even 5 table spoons of sugar didn't help. The service was average, nothing spectacular...the waiter was too busy dealing with other tables and left us waiting for her few times. Bottom line, they are serving airline food."
Debbi S.,"Bruchmühlbach-Miesau, Germany",10/6/2013,5 star rating,"Omg, all I can say is that everything we ordered for our very first visit was sooo tantalizing to our taste buds it felt like my mouth and tongue were dancing and raving to the flavors each dish provided. Every single dish was fantasmal!!Our waitress, Kristina Hoffman, was super awesome. She was helpful in every single way from suggestions to helping 2 very indecisive people figure out what to order. If you can, sit in her corner!"
Monica Q.,"CA, CA",7/21/2015,4 star rating,"I'm conflicted about this place. First things first, the food is amazing. Probably the freshest food that I've had at almost any restaurant in New York - it literally tastes like it just came out of the garden. The decor is impeccable and everything about the look, feel, and taste is fantastic. However, the service was SO SLOW! Perhaps it was the day that we went, but our table's order got messed up, as well as the table next to ours. The waiters were gracious in fixing the issue and gave us additional veggie apps to make up for the slow service, but I was somewhat shocked by the execution of the dishes.Other than that, great meal and highly recommended. Here were the dishes:- Crab toast - it is everything the other reviews say it is! Lots of crab and great flavors. Really worth the price- Sugar snap pea salad - really on the dot. The peas were so crisp and quite large and the flavorings were rich without being heavy. Fresh and delicious. - Eggs benedict - one of my eggs came out fully cooked and it was immediately taken back and redone. Great hollandaise and I loved the home fries that went with it.- Scrambled eggs and crispy oysters - My personal favorite. The eggs are European style so more runny and almost cottage cheese like, but I absolutely loved it. The oysters added a great seafood and fishy taste to it, which I loved. Again, great place, but weird service. I still highly recommend!"
Rachel S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1/16/2018,2 star rating,"I was very excited to try out ABC Kitchen but I think this must have been a better restaurant in the past than it is now. I had a reservation for a birthday dinner. Despite noting it was a birthday dinner on the reservation and notifying the hostess....when I ordered dessert our waitress still forgot to bring out the dessert with a candle. So if you're thinking of celebrating any special occasion here, think twice!! There are many other places that will take better notice of such things.In terms of the food and service, there was much left to be desired, I was definitely expecting more. The service was haphazard at most which was unexpected for a longstanding restaurant. The food was mediocre, one of our main dishes was so salty, the waitress agreed to ask the kitchen to prepare it again, but when it came back it was just as salty as the first time. We didn't want to complain too much and ended up paying for a dish we didn't really eat. Overall, seems ABC Kitchen has gone downhill."
Lori M.,"Atlanta, GA",9/26/2015,5 star rating,"It's so delightful to come to a place that is practically legendary and not be disappointed. This place is so trendy and on point. Our reservation was for 5:30 ( the only time we could get in) but we were seated around 6pm at a great table in the middle of all the action. The place was popping with couples, friends and family. You also saw a celeb or two at their leisure.Now for the menu, they have a broad selection of wines with an sampling of choices for beers and speciality drinks. Their food menu is seasonal and featured market dishes, appetizers, pastas, main courses and sides. We split a bottle of Rose and I ordered the Lobster while my sister had the Fried Chicken. We split the fries and primed our course with the calamari appetizer. The food was worth he trip to Union Square and our walking it off after #fitbitonfleekWe were super impressed with the service and even more impressed with the serving size. I will probably make this place a city staple just so I can try more dishes! Phenomenal and very well lit with an excellent ambiance. Perhaps the coolest thing was that their sister restaurant ABC Cocina was on the other side the only thing separating the two places was the kitchen in between vert cool."
James L.,"New York, NY",12/22/2015,1 star rating,"This place has disappointed me before I could even have a seat at their table. We have a 10:30 reservation and had asked to add an additional seat due to my friends birthday that day and her wanting her friends to really be there. Not only was the staff brushing her aside on the phone and saying that adding an extra seat to the last table reservation of the night would be a bother to everyone but their demeanor had suggested that they could care less the intention of our dining experience. So instead of adding one more seat, we are on the verge of cancelling our reservation and the restaurant can lose to an empty table to customers that were raving about their restaurant."
Lucy F.,"New York, NY",10/24/2018,4 star rating,"The interior design is stunning. It looks like a garden with all the small white tables and big round wooden tables, given the fact that it is right next to ABC home & carpet. My friend and I came here for lunch, and we ordered crab toast with lemon aioli, squash pizza, and bibb salad with seared salmon. The waiter recommended their burger and sandwich, but it was a little too much for two girls. The portion size was big. We finished the crab toast and the salad, but only ate half of the pizza because we were too full. The crab toast was incredible. I am not a big fan of seafood, but the crab did not taste seafood-y at all because of the lemon aioli. The crab meat was shredded and cooked, and the toast was crunchy but not overly crunchy that it would cut your tongue. There were two lemons on the side in case you need more acid. I squeezed them and they brought out the flavor of lemon aioli and freshness of crab. Although there were lots of meat, $16 was still a lot for an appetizer. The pizza I had is no longer on the menu. It was a thin crust pizza with two types of squash, ricotta, and some chili flakes. It looked like it was cooked in a wood oven due to the charred crust. The ricotta tasted a little like goat cheese to me. The chili flakes added a bit spiciness to the pizza, which was great because I love spicy food. It also added more flavor to the squash. The salad was assorted fresh vegetables with dressing (unfortunately I don't remember the dressing). The vegetables are all organic produce from local farms. It is ABC Kitchen's mission to support these farms and encourage healthy-eating with best ingredients possible. The salmon was decent, not impressive. My overall experience was great and I would go back again for dinner. The price was a little high. Three dishes cost $65 before tax and tips. Though it is reasonable for a restaurant under Jean Georges management. This place is perfect for larger groups because they have big round tables. The ambience also made the dining experience better."
Michael S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",4/30/2016,5 star rating,"Wow this place is good. We popped in without a reservation for lunch and so we waited near the bar with a glass of wine for our table. After 30 minutes or so we were seated in the same section. Make a reservation and get a table in the main dining room if you can. No regrets the way we did it, though. Watching the other patrons is great entertainment.Food is so fresh and staff is exceptional. I had a Raviolo with a magical egg yolk inside that burst at precisely the right moment. Don't miss!"
David D.,"Newtown, PA",7/13/2015,5 star rating,"I came here with friends.  Great vibe.The hostess was especially gracious since we were 30 minutes late for our reservation, but once we entered the space we were transported to an ultra-hip experience. I thought they did especially well with vegetables. The servers wearing flannel shirts was a bit much for me, but I get it.Apps- Portabello mushroom - maybe a highlight, this was perfectly seared and infused with a celery sauce. Rich and tasty- Avocado salad over micro greens - despite the strange gargantuan fried croutons, which everyone avoided, a good example of the fresh greens at this Kitchen- Meat and cheese board - cheeses were local from the Northeast and held their own against the more interesting charcuterie selections. The bread was a hearty multigrain variety, which my European guests did not appreciate as much as they would have a crisp, thinly sliced baguette- Sweet peas - a seasonal dish, small portion, but served with a sweet sauce and some ""long hots,"" IIRC, in Philadelphia terminology. I liked the sweet and peppery component of the dishMains- Akaushi jalapeno burgers - Japanese beef was excellent, and somehow more flavorful than some ""kobe"" beef burgers I have tasted in the past. The sesame seed bun was like a super high end burger-king bun (sorry to paint that image in your mind), but it was good. The cheese, great, the jalapeños a bit overwhelming. The fries with which it was served were standout- Halibut - perfectly cooked and complemented nicely were tomatoes and summer squash- Salmon - over sugar snap peas and herbs, the sauce was wonderful and a touch sweet, while the fish itself, a 7-ounce portion, was good if not particularly spectacular. I could have done with a slightly more charred skin, as it was somewhat all oily over the sauceFor desserts we split the cookies (delectable), ice cream sundae (as good as pronounced), and fruit plate (sophisticated, tiny strawberries = super sweet!)."

David E.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1/18/2020,5 star rating,"Always great, extremely consistent.  Ricotta or stracciatella (whichever soft cheese they are offering to start) are always great.  Carrot salad, any of their fish, mushroom pizza are all winners.  Dessert, chocolate cake or sundae, etc., are all classics.  Beautiful room with great lighting, good spacing between tables.  Servers are pros.  Jean-Georges really knows what he is doing here (as in many of his other restaurants).  Top notch."
YR 7.,"Geneva, Switzerland",12/16/2018,3 star rating,"The mushroom pizza, crab toast, and ravioli were good but nothing too special or worth going back for. Beautiful setting, average food."
Eric J.,"New York, NY",4/6/2015,4 star rating,"Organic, grass-fed everything. I had previously been here for brunch, but recently snagged a reservation for 2 for dinner the week of. We decided that we would kind of go for broke and order as much as we cared to, throwing all caution to the wind. Very glad we did, because it definitely paid off. We made most of decisions off of Yelp recommendations, so excuse us for adding just another picture to the pile of 10,000. The decor is very quirky but still upscale and elevated. The only thing that I didn't quite understand were the misshapen plates that looked like pottery class rejects. The clientele is a pretty diverse mix, with couples just having an elegant casual dinner, to recently graduated young professionals dressed to the nines, trying to make sure they were seen at such a upmarket establishment. I was definitely the former, but I remember a time when I was just like the latter, so I can't hate.Anyways, we started the meal with the crab toast and the mushroom pizza which was perfect. Toast was just the right amount of crunch and chew, and the crab was fresh and well seasoned, while pairing well with the lemon aioli. The mushroom pizza, though, was probably my favorite thing all night. The crust was just right, the hen of the woods mushrooms were delicious, and the runny egg dropped at the middle of the pizza just put it over the top. For our entrees, we ordered the fried chicken over collard greens and hot sauce butter and the black sea bass. The fried chicken was huge, and just the right amount of crisp, and the fried crust soaking up that hot sauce butter was perfect. The black sea bass was cooked just right too, and was fork tender, without being mushy. We ended the meal with the salted caramel sundae, which was again, huge and great. There was just a huge pool of chocolate sauce on the bottom, and the salted caramel peanut popcorn and ice cream was a good counter for all the sweetness.One thing I should point out is that the service was pretty suspect. The roaming waitstaff were attentive enough in refilling our drinks, bringing out silverware, and our courses, but the waitress who took our order took an inordinately long time to check in on us throughout the meal. As a result, we ended up waiting almost 20 minutes for the check. Not great. Prices are what you expect from Jean-Georges establishments, but not entirely unreasonable. Just need to up the attentiveness of the service, and it'll be perfect. You kinda know what you're getting with this restaurant, and the food is definitely well-executed. It's a good place for a fancier-than-average date, or dinner with a small group."
Janel G.,"Queens, NY",1/17/2019,5 star rating,My favorite place to go!!! The food is absolutely delicious. I have been to ABC kitchen at least three dozen times. I have never been disappointed. The service has been excellent and very accommodating. I would recommend this venue over and over again.
Chelsea L.,"New York, NY",8/19/2016,5 star rating,"I came here in a group of 5 for a summer work lunch and the restaurant week menu ($29).  We made a reservation weeks in advance but I know some of the front tables are left for walk ins. The décor and atmosphere of the whole place is beautiful and modern, which makes sense since they own a home goods store.  We all started off with the Shaved Raw Fluke which was fresh and covered in a light dressing.  The cuts were the perfect size and a nice sized portion for the appetizer. The dressing was delicious and we used some of the table bread to dip in it.  We also ordered the Mushroom Pizza ($22) for the table outside of the Restaurant Week Menu. It was completely covered in a variety of different mushrooms, which I was a huge fan of.  It also had an egg in the middle making it richer.I ordered the Portobello Sandwich, and also got to try the Raviolo and the Salmon.  The Portobello Sandwich is probably the best I've had, for something that can be very bland.  It had a lot of flavor from the jalapenos and lemon mayo.  Also the rosemary fries that come with it are so good, wish I could've had more.  The Salmon is definitely the healthiest of these choices and comes surrounded by roasted carrots.  The carrot sauce was delicious if you like carrots, probably would've enjoyed the sauce a soup, to be honest.  The salmon was a very tender cut and nicely fell apart, we asked for it cooked to medium and I thought it was perfect.  The Raviolo was so good and rich.  It was excellent with the pork ragu sauce and the egg in the middle.  I would definitely recommend trying this with the heads up that it is very heavy.The two desserts were Chocolate Cake and Strawberry Pavlova.  The Chocolate Cake was the most moist cake I've ever had and the marshmallow icing added nice texture.  It also had malted milk chocolate balls on it.  I didn't know what to expect for the Strawberry Pavlova, but it was strawberry sorbet on top of a ""meringue"", with fresh strawberries on the side."

He was down to earth, attentive and knowledgeable. The staff is absolutely well trained here and the food is delicious. We will certainly be back."
Benjamin H.,"Tampa, FL",10/4/2017,1 star rating,"THE ABC OF LIES LIES LIES. I have waited tables, cooked in the kitchen, managed and currently own restaurants. My family came to NYC on a family trip and wanted to come to ABC. Made reservations 2 months ago for 9 people at 9p. The reason it was so late is because when we made the reservations we were told their policy is that that is the only time they take reservations for party's our size. When we arrived we were told they were getting the table ready. LIE #1 15 minutes later it turns out they weren't getting the table ready because the table hadn't even finished and were still at the table eating dessert. NOTE:  THE TABLE WE WERE WAITING ON WAS A PARTY OF 9. REMEMBER THE RESTAURANTS POLICY OF RESERVATION SIZE?  LIE #2. The restaurant wasn't straight up with us from the start. I understand that things fall a little behind in the business but for it to fall 30-45 minutes late is completely unacceptable and shameful(we never found out how long it was going to be because we left at 9:35). The manager kept on coming up to us telling us the we're almost done and the check had been presented blah blah blah. LIES LIES LIES (I've lost count at this point). The manager kept saying that they can't ask them to leave. She would never do that to anyone. Finally we got out of her that the reason for it being so delayed was because the party had shown up late. Without a doubt,  at this point she should have told the party that they needed the table because they showed up late. There is absolutely no reason to have a party with reservations wait that amount of time. I don't care if you're the most casual restaurant in town or the fanciest. Who the hell do they think they are? The attitude and ego was palpable. It felt like we were doing them a favor by eating at this restaurant. Someone needs to teach them the ABC's of customer service and the food industry."
Apple C.,"Seattle, WA",4/20/2014,5 star rating,"LOVE this place! The decor is chic, and the food is yummy with farm to table ingredients. What more do I need to say? Their fried chicken is probably the best fried chicken I've ever had. SUPER JUICY!!! The crust was very light and crunchy in a way that I've never had on fried chicken before. Not to mention it's organic. Definitely worth the try. My friends had pasta and pizza, and they were both delicious. I would probably order every single item on the menu because they all sounded so good. Just wish I had room to try some appetizers. Next time for sure! On the downside, it's kind of hard to get a reservation :("
Keara S.,"New York, NY",2/1/2018,5 star rating,This place came highly recommended from friends has been in my bookmarks for awhile. I was super excited to book a reservation for a business dinner and it did not disappoint. The pretzel dusted calamari is a must try. I had the sea bass with spinach and potatoes and everything was just so delicious and fresh. The chocolate cake with marshmallow icing is the stuff of dreams. Will definitely be making my way back here again.
Saul R.,"Austin, TX",12/8/2018,5 star rating,"This place is easy to miss! look for entrance carefully, great food! enjoyed the veggie burger w a threesbrewing beer"
Bill J.,"Chicago, IL",8/14/2018,2 star rating,"Meh. It Was fine. What does it say when mash potatoes are the star? What is it about this menu that warrants the hype!  I am truly not sure. The bread. Sullivan bakery. My wife and Dana make better bread. The chicken, way over greasy. Blah. The roasted lobster. Fine. The ravioli. Fine. The cucumber salad was an A. Pass on the calamari. Yuck. The radishes with butter were . . . Fine. Good service. Don't come here for anything special other than the vibe. Overall:  a great Big over-hyped Fine. Much much better meals in all of NYC."
Michael D.,"West Hartford, CT",7/27/2015,1 star rating,Food was good but not exceptional. Over priced for tapas imo.Wait staff was elitest and borderline rude and dirty.
Jessica T.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",4/15/2018,4 star rating,"they took away their angel hair pasta! that was by far my favorite dish. so sad. the new one they replaced it with - casarecce with fennel sausage, broccoli rabe and shepherd's basket cheese - does not compare. it was way too salty and the broccoli was too bitter for the dish. i was so disappointed, not sure i would go back unless they bring it back!"
MJ D.,"Norwalk, CT",5/17/2018,4 star rating,Very nice experience for us. Beautiful setting and foods were not disappointing. Chef Jean-Georges stopped by tables to tables greeting clients was special too! We enjoyed our light meal after furniture shopping right next door.
Arshi K.,"Hoboken, NJ",3/26/2015,4 star rating,"The husband decided to treat me to a fantastic Jean Georges birthday lunch here and it was well worth it. If you haven't been to ABC Kitchen before, you could easily miss the entrance, as it comes across as pretty unassuming from outside. Once you step inside, you're transported to a beautiful, vintag-y space - the décor is part rustic, part uber chic with lanterns, wooden tables and eclectic chinaware which we loved. Perfect for a date night or a girls night out. The experience was pretty much seamless, like a well-orchestrated dance - we were greeted by the host + hostess warmly, checked in our coats and waited for 5 minutes soaking in the ambiance and then were escorted to our table. The Food: Since this was a casual Sunday afternoon lunch/brunch meal, we opted for a few small plates and decided to share. Now when these guys promise a farm-to-table experience with the freshest ingredients they mean it. Mostly everything we tried (except the pizza) was bursting with flavors and the presentation was lovely.  * Crab Toast with Lemon Aioli: topped with luscious crab meat and zesty aioli, it looked unassuming, till we took a bite. The flavors are quite rich and you must love crab to like this one. #sogood* Roasted Carrot Salad: Never been a huge fan of roasted carrot or given carrot as a vegetable much thought! But this salad will make me explore options when it comes to this underwhelming vegetable. We really enjoyed the salad, especially the pairing of crunchy seeds with the slightly charred carrot and the citrusy avocado. Perfect. * Spinach Goat cheese herbs pizza: I've had better, this one wasn't crispy enough and would have liked to see more of the goat cheese. The cheese to spinach ratio didn't work for me, nor did the addition of kale to the mix. Unimpressive.* Almond cake with vanilla ice cream, cranberry-orange compote: If you like simplicity, you'll like this desert - the flavors are subtle and the ice-cream is a nice creamy companion to the sponge cake. * Thyme lemonade - There was a green drink on the menu that I wanted to try (with Kale, spinach etc), but they ran out of it. So we got the thyme lemonade instead - it was super refreshing, but don't expect a jumbo glass of lemonade like your  friendly neighborhood café! While they are not exactly stingy, it's not a lot to keep you going through out the meal.The service  was top notch. With pretty much back-to-back reservations it must be tough to give everyone a consistently relaxed experience but they've found the right balance.PRO TIP: Must book at least 3 weeks in advance to get your preferred time slot or you'll be stuck with odd hours like 3 pm or 10 pm."
Christine Y.,"New York, NY",8/13/2015,5 star rating,"It's no doubt 5-star for ABC Kitchen! This place is really a hidden gem. You may easily walk by without noticing it due to its super humble front door. But once you get inside, ooh my God, like entering Alice's wonderland! Décor is so chic, so feminine, so lovely! Service was outstanding. Our waitress was very pretty, very friendly and very helpful at recommending signature dishes to us. Food was deliiiiiicious. My friend and I had the raw fluke, the crab toast, the egg Benedict with ham, and the salted caramel ice cream, that many other yelpers have recommended. We had our taste buds satisfied, our thumbs up and our faces smiling. No doubt so many people gave this place such good reviews. We will surely come here again and again! Highly recommend it!"
L W.,"Seattle, WA",1/4/2018,4 star rating,"Great service and ambiance. The host wasn't as friendly but our waiter was super attentive and very personable. He provided some great recommendations which we ended up going with. Must order the kobacha squash toast. It's a seasonal item so be sure to order it! Next up was the mushroom, thyme and ricotta wood oven fire pizza. It was topped with a soft farm egg. To finish off dinner, we had two different pasta dishes - ricotta ravioli and pistachio pesto fettucine. All dishes were fresh and light somewhAt. With the intent of the ingredients to stand on its own without tons of work and seasoning. Def worth the reservation/visit!"
Charles L.,"Baltimore, MD",2/17/2016,5 star rating,"An amazing dinner! We stopped in for dinner in a cold and rainy night, and the ABC Kitchen was warm and welcoming. First we had olives and a delicious crab toast with lemon aioli. My son had an excellent pizza with crispy crust, spot charred on the bottom with tangy tomato sauce on top. My wife had hake with crispy potatoes and broccoli. I chose the red snapper swimming in a light broth. We finished with three doughnuts.  A terrific meal !"
Anika C.,"Queens, Queens, NY",1/9/2020,4 star rating,"Was a great date night. All of the dishes were nice, and so was the service. It was a bit loud but it is nyc. The salted caramel sundae was delicious."
Beth S.,"Manhattan, NY",8/18/2015,5 star rating,"My #1 favorite restaurant in NYC.  The decor is what I would call country chic - the china is floral and makes you feel right at home.  Farm to table cuisine is their mantra, and the food is fresh and tasty.  My favorite starters are the carrot and avocado salad (roasted carrots, avocado with a spicy kick to the dressing) and the beets (served with a tart yogurt sauce).  The pizza is amazing and not to be missed.  But the real stand out is the dessert.  The salted caramel sundae with hot fudge and popcorn is literally the best dessert in Manhattan (and accordingly has been rated as such).  Only complaint?  It's virtually impossible to get a dinner reservation."
Susan H.,"New York, NY",6/19/2018,5 star rating,Had dinner with a friend from out of town and we totally enjoyed the experience here. Their cocktails are on point and the food was great. I enjoyed the fish more than the pizza shown in the pictures. We really liked the ambiance too. I would say this is a perfect spot for a date night!!!
Peggy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",2/13/2018,3 star rating,"A friend and I came here recently for dinner. We had both been here before multiple times and loved it. Even without reservations, we were able to grab a seat at the bar after only having to wait a short while which was lucky. Service was very friendly and attentive. Our food, however, was only so-so this time and that was really disappointing. I got the squash toast and the mushroom pizza while my friend got the calamari appetizer as well as a fish entrée. While I love the squash toast I do think at this point it is a tad overpriced for what it is (and I have personally made it before so I know how much work goes into it). It took a very long time for our entrées to come out and when they finally did my pizza mushroom had clearly been sitting out for a little while-it was a bit cold and the egg on top had been cooked too long and the yolk was no longer runny. My friend's calamari was pretty chewy and her fish dish was very unmemorable. Honestly, if we had been rating ABC Kitchen based on previous visits they would have received four stars easily at the very least, but unfortunately this trip didn't measure up. I still have fond memories of this place, and I do appreciate that we were able to still have dinner here without a reservation. One winning attribute: whoever is doing their floral arrangements should get an extra kudos! They are so lovely and unique without being overly stuffy."
Susie K.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",6/17/2018,4 star rating,"My favorite restaurant in the ABC restaurant empire. Getting reservations is regularly difficult, so I would suggest arriving 5-10 mins before opening to snag a walk-in table. Beautiful interior though the staff can sometimes feel pretentious."
Sarah L.,"Ridgewood, NJ",1/8/2019,5 star rating,We had our department holiday dinner here. It was fabulous! Very attentive staff and inventive options for dinner. Everything was delicious and the decor was unusual and elegant. We all loved it!
Agent W.,"Tacoma, WA",9/27/2016,4 star rating,"Vibrant lunch spot, 'hip' crowd. Love the interior. Had the burger which was good; meat was tender (even at medium well) loved the grilled smoky taste, but a little too charred (was slightly bitter) and it could have been more tasty to be honest. Fries seasoned with rosemary, garlic and cheese, and i believe double fried, were the BEST ever!!"
Vicki G.,"New York, NY",9/25/2018,3 star rating,Went here for my birthday. We liked the place but thought it was pricey for what it offered. ABC Kitchen is a staple in NYC but we thought it is a little over rated and expensive.
Itai B.,"Boston, MA",11/10/2015,3 star rating,"Went to dinner at ABC kitchen with my whole family to celebrate my sister's bday. Our family had a great experience. Key Take Aways:Service was good not spectacularFried chicken was good not spectacular Ambience was good. Lighting and noise level were just about right. If there was music playing I couldn't hear it. It was quite loud but fun environment.Overall, I didn't leave ABC feeling very special. Food was overall very good, not insanely lick your lips after every bite amazing. Wait staff was cordial but didn't go the extra mile to be memorable."
Emily H.,"Philadelphia, PA",1/17/2017,5 star rating,I was beyond excited to try this restaurant during my first visit to New York. I was not disappointed. The menu was amazing and I found it difficult narrowing my choices down as I wasn't to try everything. I love that the food is sourced locally and the dishes are presented so lovely. The location is great and I was enjoying the soft lighting. I had the pork belly then for dessert I have the sundae with popcorn. A great wine list too!
Jordan B.,"Lake George, NY",1/1/2019,5 star rating,The service was wonderful and the food was even better! Imagine that!! We really enjoyed our evening and are looking to come back!
Star P.,"Brooklyn, NY",7/21/2014,4 star rating,4 1/2 StarsI came here about 3 weeks ago with a friend visiting from Chicago. We were very much looking forward to eating here and they did not disappoint. From the moment we arrived to when we left it was a wonderful experience.The heirloom tomato toast was simple but wonderful- fresh and vibrant. The crab toast (as everyone says) is an absolute must have!! The diver scallops and sea beans were also delicious. For entrees we had the lobster and the halibut with pistachios- both winners.For dessert I had chiffon cake with rhubarb. I no longer see it on the menu which is a good thing because it was a disappointment. She had the lemon tart and it was an absolute dream. It was SO good that I literally had a dream about it that night. I can't wait to eat here again :)
Nina N.,"New York, NY",11/7/2018,5 star rating,"celebrated my BFF's birthday year. Cannot ask for more - beautiful restaurant, great food and such attentive staff! We did not say that it was my friend's birthday but our adorable waitress overheard us and surprised us with a birthday cake! Must try!"
Jennifer B.,"New York, NY",6/8/2017,3 star rating,I've been to ABC kitchen on a few occasions.  Once for brunch and two times for dinner.  My first visit for dinner was great.  We enjoyed everything that we ordered.  However on my most recent visit for dinner the food was just not good.  I ordered the carrot avocado salad as an appetizer as I did the first time and it tasted completely different.  The taste of spices and vinegar was so overwhelming that neither I nor my friend could finish the dish.  For an entree I ordered the angel hair pasta which was bland and flavorless.  Service was very good but I unfortunately will not be returning due to the meal I had.
Leah C.,"Highland Park, IL",12/24/2017,4 star rating,"We were told that there was about a 45 minute wait for a table for two. Because I was STARVING, this made me pretty upset. But walking around ABC home made the wait fly by. The store is huge and has everything you could wish for (We snacked on lavender and rose flavored chocolates!). After being seated, a while went by before we were greeted by our waitress. Nonetheless, she was very sweet. The food was great. We got the butternut squash soup (which was amazing), crab toast, kale salad, and fig prosciutto pizza. The portions were small and the prices steep, but everything was fresh and delicious. My only complaint is that our table was tall and unstable. The dishes are very delicate, so I felt nervous something was going to fall and break. Plus, our chairs were not comfortable, they were hard and flimsy."
Christina P.,"Orange County, CA",10/3/2013,4 star rating,"Sometimes you can just tell you're going to have an excellent meal. This feeling served me correct when I walked in to the dimly lit/anthropologie-esque decor. Unfortunately, we did not have reservations and walk-ins appeared to be a never-ending line of people trying to take the next available seat at the bar. Fortunately, my friends old roommate happens to work there and voila, we were seated just like that. I felt like the hot girls going walking into the club bypassing the line. Upon seating we were greeted with a complimentary flute of rose and heirloom tomato toast. What a great start to the evening. We placed an order for crab toast, the salad of the day, and the okra with shisito peppers. My goodness. Everything was great. Not a huge okra fan but the way they fixed this dish was simply remarkable. You can taste the quality of each item. For our entrees we had the halibut and the fresh linguine with corn. The fish was amazingly fresh and clean. The pasta dish is where my friend and I agreed was not the highlight of the night. It had good flavor but the sweet corn got overwhelming and killed it for us. Overall, a wonderful dining experience in the city and cannot wait to go back for the ice cream with popcorn!"
Meg Z.,"Sunnyvale, CA",4/16/2016,5 star rating,"Came here for brunch and had a great experience. We had mushroom tacos, a corn plate to share, and a salad (can't remember what it was called exactly). Really fun environment and great food! Good place to bring out of towners."
Courtney C.,"New York, NY",7/12/2018,1 star rating,"Came back again for a business lunch; had to wait 25 minutes despite having a reservation.  The main hostess was entitled and rude.  The other hostesses were clueless.  The server was so timid that I could barely understand what she was saying.  The appetizers were good (the fluke!) but the entrees (specifically, the fried fish) were awful - greasy and lacking flavor.  Would never bring clients here again (or dine here myself).  A few blocks away you have have impeccable service at Gramercy Tavern or Union Square Cafe in an equally nice venue - my flatiorn business people, don't waste your precious time waiting on this pretentious spot."
Amanda L.,"Brooklyn, NY",7/15/2015,4 star rating,"Another great brunch spot!We had the crab toast and lemon aioli to share. The mountain of crab on the toast was sweet and refreshing. The bread was very crunchy and it tasted similar to the bread they served on the table. Def recommend this as a starter for a small group. We were able to have it split into 3 instead of 2. I had the eggs benedict with flying pigs farm ham. I don't think you can ever go wrong with eggs benedict. The simple dish was good for one or to share. And after having this bookmarked for so long, I'm even more excited to come back for dinner."
Candis D.,"Brooklyn, NY",7/6/2015,3 star rating,"People rave about ABC Kitchen, and I still haven't figured out why.  Until today, I've been avoiding it since my last visit since what I remembered was the most flavorless food I had ever had.  I am happy to say that the food today was measurably better than it was on my first visit.  I ordered the pre-fixe lunch.  My appetizer was the pea soup.  It was very good.  I especially like the croutons.  My entree was the chicken.  This is what I was dreading from my bland earlier experience.  It was definitely better.  The chicken was well-cooked and the jalapenos added a nice spice.  However, I found the dish to be rather salty.  It was like all the salt they sucked out of my first meal was doubled into this one.  But hey, I'll take salty over bland any day, no matter what my cardiovascular system says.  The dessert was the highlight of my meal.  The raspberry tart was so good.  It was the perfect amount of sweet, and the fresh berries tricked my mind into thinking that it was healthy.  What more could a girl want in a dessert?"
Elle L.,"Century City, Los Angeles, CA",7/4/2013,5 star rating,"The outside is unassuming. It's a small sign starved door within a large building block. The inside almost replicates Anthropologie, from the upcycled frames to the worn wood floors. The servers wear etsy-esque floral aprons. The whole thing is so darn cute!!!Sure, there are plenty of places that do the farm fresh to table concept, but not quite like ABC and not quite as delicious. The serving sizes are a tad small, but makes up in big flavors. The vegetables de jour are all piled up on a big table right outside the kitchen, so you get to witness chefs coming out, smelling and feeling out the vegetables for quality. Then you get it see it on your plate. We ordered the carrot avocado salad, as recommended by yelp. The carrots were surprisingly small, but few bites in, and we had no complaints - it was delicious. The most notable part of the dinner was the suckling pig. Tender, juicy and flavorful. The skin is roasted to be crisp for bite. The whole meal was a bit on the pricey side, as we didn't leave full at all. Our satisfaction was full though! Overall, ABC is a place worth visiting at least once. and maybe another when you aren't too hungry."
Melanie M.,"Pelham, AL",10/29/2016,4 star rating,We scored brunch reservations! Very attentive servers - excellent experience. The food was delicious - try the scrambled eggs w crispy oysters (sounds weird but it works) w a side of cheddar biscuits.
Celine B.,"Boston, MA",11/20/2017,1 star rating,"For such an upscale place, I would expect they'd know how to make pizza. I ordered a few entrees and appetizers, amongst which was the mushroom pizza, which looked fine at the top. However, on my first bite, I unknowingly ate a tablespoon worth of uncooked flour that was left at the bottom of my slice. At first, I didn't realize it since the lighting was so terribly dim that I was barely able to see my food, but then I shined a flashlight and saw an ungodly amount of RAW FLOUR. It took 3 minutes before I felt nauseous and threw up everything I ate before that. Needless to say, I have lost trust in the restaurant and feel discouraged to return."
Kimberly W.,"Scottsdale, AZ",5/15/2016,5 star rating,"Yum, yum, yum! Healthy and delicious!! The crab toast is a must and it is to die for!! The carrotini drink is so freaking good I couldn't stop drinking them! The staff and ambiance is fab! And everything on the menu is delicious! The mushroom farm egg pizza is unbelievable I want to go back for it now! And the kale salad which I added grilled chicken breast to was so yummy! This is definitely in my top restaurants in NY! Can't wait to go back!"
Lara A.,"New York, NY",12/24/2014,5 star rating,"Excellent service, ambience, and FOOD :) I've been here countless times and never fail to be impressed or have a wonderful time. We ordered two house made sodas, one basil lime and one cherry lime - both excellent and refreshing, the cherry lime was in the sweet side but that's what I wanted to I was happy with my order.My and my guest ordered soups, the butternut squash soup was fabulous, sweet and warm. The cauliflower special soup with croutons and manchego cheese was sooo creamy despite it being vegan! We shared the main size portion of the ricotta ravioli which I order every time I visit,Soooo indescribably perfect :) We also shared the turkey sandwich which to be honest, the sauce and the bread were sooo good but the turkey itself was like cold cuts (I remember and would expect a place like this to have fresh turkey). Anyways,It was really yummy :)And last but not least the alter caramel icecream with peanuts and caramel popcorn and chocolate fudge was so good just like Everytime.Consistency, ABC kitchen is consistently perfect. That's what matters. Enjoy!"
Heather F.,"Murrieta, CA",7/12/2015,5 star rating,"I truly believe that 60% of a dining experience is about the food and 40% is about the energy, vibe, feeling you have while at the establishment. Many factors contribute to the "" feeling"" you have the hostess, server, even fellow dinners around you.  With ABC kitchen I am giving it 5 stars because of the feeling I had it was a true fun and memorable dining experience. I truly did not like my veggie burger ( too dry) but as tourists in New York we waited at the bar to be seated and sat next to a very talkative New York couple! This conversation was priceless also the libations were beautiful and tasty I'm a sucker for gorgeous glassware and garnishing! I loved the dessert ( blueberry tart) and then the shopping next door was fun to say the least! Fun place to eat in New York!"
Greg M.,"Menlo Park, CA",12/19/2016,5 star rating,"Went there for a solo lunch on my first trip to NYC this past Jan, and been meaning to write about it ever since.  Beautiful décor, fun ambience, unpretentious -- I liked the style of the menu presentation and the simple attire of the service staff; Alex, my server, was attentive, friendly, knowledgeable, and graciously answered with my erratic questions.  I had the roasted carrot and avocado salad: perfect, then the crab toast... so tasty.  I went for the sandwich 'cause I didn't want to spend TOO too much, but next time (yes, definitely saving up for a next time) I'm gonna get something more original.  To you: go. Have dinner.  It'll add up.  But it's worth it. ( I should say, I'm not as inclined to write about more upscale restaurants as I am to speak about them -- there's something that only word of mouth can give you about the experience, that a yelp review cannot. but in this case, I simply had to write something)"
Deb L.,"West Village, Manhattan, NY",10/27/2017,3 star rating,"One of my favorite places in NYC to dine. However,the mushroom egg pizza on a scale of 1 to 10, was a 1 last night. Soggy crust, watery mushrooms made it impossible to eat. It was like having a pizza soup. You might just need a new pizza oven."
Morgan H.,"Chapel Hill, NC",12/17/2016,5 star rating,One of my favorite restaurants in the city! The ambiance and food is surreal. You must try it!
Eli T.,"New York, NY",6/24/2018,5 star rating,"I think it's a perfect restaurant. I've been to a lot of places and this nails it! Great customer service, waiters who know their shit, and spectacular food. Not to mention everything is organic and seasonal. Will come back again!"
Stacey T.,"Austin, TX",6/16/2017,5 star rating,"Didn't think the service or space were anything to write home about but the food was outstanding. The lightest, fluffiest ravioli I've ever tasted. Not the kind of pasta you simply fill up on and then feel miserable about later. Out of this world cheeses. The perfect meat and cheese plate pairings. I think I inhaled the sea bass in broth because it was so flavorful - the epitome of umami. Brilliant peach sorbet."
Katherine C.,"Manhattan, NY",6/19/2016,5 star rating,"Had a birthday dinner here this weekend and was not disappointed in the least. The decor is both clean and rustic at the same time with boho flair (ex perfectly mismatched plates). Dim lighting with tons of twinkling lights give it a romantic feel. Service was excellent, non-intrusive yet attentive. The food was awesome. Started out with the crab toast which was, as promised, a revelation. Super crab-y and bright, definitely the highlight of the night. We loved the roasted carrot and avocado salad, perfectly dressed and the roasted carrots were delicious. Mains were the red snapper and the burger both of which were perfectly cooked (though maybe less unique). We had the seasonal cherry pie for dessert which was good though I would have appreciated more filling and less crust. The pistachio ice cream that came with it was the perfect mix of salty and sweet and was spot on. I loved my Meyer lemon mimosa and my SO enjoyed his pear and whiskey cocktail. Loved that the food was lighter and that we didn't leave feeling obese.Would definitely return!"
Lan-Anh N.,"Manhattan, NY",8/13/2016,5 star rating,"I would give this restaurant a 5 not because it is exceptional on a Michelin standard, but it offers a very good dining experience. The food is good and fresh and the ambiance is also cool. I would highly recommend this spot for lunch."
Charlee D.,"Brooklyn, NY",6/18/2014,4 star rating,"I've been meaning to come here but never had an occasion. My friend was visiting from London and it was his birthday, so I figured what better time to try the acclaimed ABC Kitchen.The food was excellent. Bright, light and filling. There were so many textures and the flavors blended well. The presentation was perfect. The servers were efficient and polite. It was everything I hoped for and had expected. I didn't care for our chairs. Their location in the restaurant and design were a bit uncomfortable, but otherwise gorgeous experience overall."
Merideth M.,"Rehoboth, MA",12/28/2015,5 star rating,"Absolute perfection. Went here about a year ago to celebrate a friend's birthday and shocked I never wrote a review! The inside of the restaurant is absolute beautiful and natural. Their food is organic and they have a vegetable garden on the rooftop of their building and there's nothing I appreciate more than food that is treated properly. While there, our waiter was very attentive and professional and so was the rest of the staff that we came into contact with. There was the traditional complimentary bread served with a side of olive oil and I added some sea salt to it which I recommend doing. For an appetizer we got the calamari which came dressed like a pretzel and came with marina sauce and musters aioli. The mustard aioli really brought the pretzel idea to life. For my main course, I had the kasha and bow tie pasta which came with veal meatballs. Honestly it's been a year since I've eaten it but I still think about it all the time! Amazing, the sauce was a brown sauce which was sweet and came with this little round nuts that gave the pasta an nice crunch and the veal meatballs melted in my mouth. I highly recommend getting this pasta. Very wonderful. For dessert I had ice cream and sorbet and when getting this you get to choose three flavors. Great restaurant! I will definitely go again!"
Stan S.,"New York, NY",3/21/2017,3 star rating,"Had a terrific Sunday Brunch reserved at Noon. Place was just starting to fill and yet enough room for priivacy. The lighting and ambiance was very comfortable. Our party of 4 started out sharing  appetizer crab toast with lemon aioli and Line Caught Tuna Sashimi and a bottle of their Cava sparkling water.  We found the toast itself was very hard but the crab was delicious with little to no binding filler. So be careful not to bite too hard or you just may lose a tooth.  The tuna Sashimi was very fresh with nice consistancy of oil and tender (melts in your mouth).    As for Entree I had their Eggs Benedict with ham on a toasted muffin.  The  2 Eggs were perfectly cooked and I enjoyed how the yoke on both eggs just oooozzzed over the ham and muffin. Just perfectly cooked along with their potatos. We also had black bass over a bed of spinach which was cooked just right.  The other fish we had was their Roasted Hake. The waitress described it similar to a Halibut. Unfortunately, the Roasted Hake fish was almost the size of a deck of card and it was served with a (1) peeled brussel sprout. So this Hake fish portion was maybe enough for a 5 year old child. Our other party had their delicious sauteed Skuna Bay Salmon with roasted carrots and basil. He really enjoyed it but the portion was lacking as well. By this time we had just finished our round of drinks (2 Manhattan and 2 Grey Goose Martini).For desert we had their delicious rasberry sorbet (3 scoops). It wasn't overly sweet and the size was perfect. Also had they creme brulee and that was WOW with coffee.As for the service I would say she was okay. Nice but not rude. We got the feeling she had other things on her mind other than working that day.In all our meal with gratuity was shy of $400.  I would've given 4 stars if the portion was more ADULT SIZE vs Children SIZE and if we had a friendlier waitress."
Amy L.,"Brooklyn, NY",2/11/2018,4 star rating,"Looking for a fancy birthday dinner but don't want to miss a day of healthy eating? Then ABC Kitchen is your spot. Decor, service, and taste are a high 4 out of 5. My friends and I each got an entree and shared a pizza that had brussels sprouts...which didn't taste like cardboard surprisingly! I also really enjoyed the crab toast lemon aioli, but thumbs down for small portions as a consequence of chic eating. Liked my entree even more, which was black bass with chilies, herbs, spinach and basil. Normally I wouldn't order fish just because I don't think it's worth the price and flavor. Yet this black bass had just the right amount of sweet and sour. Top it off with some baby market potatoes and I indulged myself in a good ol' American dinner. Which must've been really good because I rarely eat like this when I go out. And although this was one of the most expensive group meals I've had, it was well worth it."
J T.,"Beverly Hills, CA",4/3/2017,1 star rating,"ABC Kitchen came highly recommended by a friend.  Made a reservation for noon on a Saturday. We entered the restaurant through the back near the ABC carpet store.  Walking through the restaurant to the hostess stand--it was empty--tons of empty tables.  We checked in with the hostess right before noon who said we'd get seated ""in a few minutes""  We ended up waiting about 20 minutes before we were seated--with no explanation and no acknowledgement of the fact that we had a reservation.  And there were empty tables everywhere!Once seated it took over 15 minutes for a waiter to even come to our table and bring us a menu and water. We saw the waiter 3 times in total--the first time he came to our table to drop off a menu, the time he took our order and then when we flagged him down for the check. With a noon reservation, we finally received water at 12:50. We joked about just leaving at that point.  Food arrived and was nothing special (turkey sandwich & Angel Hair w/ ricotta). Both were bland. Terrible service and mediocre food"
Lori Y.,"Manhattan, NY",1/10/2016,4 star rating,"The ambiance & décor were fantastic - from the outside it looked like an interior decorating exhibit, and from the inside it was designed with nature/forest themes which were very neat. The menu even has descriptions of where the designs came from, which was cool.The food was fine, bit pricey for the quality imo.We got the:Mushroom and egg pizza - this was great! A bit small though (and some people exiting the restaurant commented that our pizza was much smaller than theirs, so there needs to be some more quality control here)Pork confit - the texture was great; it was as soft as butter, but wasn't very flavorfulSalted caramel ice cream w. popcorn - thought this was okay honestly. Tastes like what it sounds like."
Sofia C.,"San Francisco, CA",1/4/2019,5 star rating,"Great ambiance. Highly reccomend the ""fried"" chicken with hot butter sauce over spinach. The chicken was actually coated with tempura-like flakes which was delicious and the squash side was amazing! Will definitely be back."
Eric P.,"New York, NY",6/9/2018,4 star rating,Food is delicious and healthy. The wait time is a bit ridiculous. Waited an hour and half on the weekday for two people. But I guess it's worth the wait. So make sure you make the reservation before your next visit.
Hannah B.,"Portland, OR",2/8/2016,4 star rating,"This spot reminds me of California dining. I especially appreciate that their menu includes sourcing of everything from meat to produce. I tried the following:Brussels sprouts with bacon and pear-Delicious. The bacon is thick and perfectly cooked while the pear gives a hint of sweetness to balance out the dish. I only wish they had cut the sprouts in half before cooking. I always enjoy mine with a little crisp on the leaves. Regardless, this was delicious. Spinach, goat cheese and herb pizza-Amazing! The herbs make this pizza very unique and almost addicting. I would eat this over and over again. Crab toast with lemon aioli-The crab was amazing. Very fresh and not overly 'sauced'. It was simple and delicious. I do wish the toast wasn't so hard though. It felt more like a crouton and almost hurt to eat. Roasted carrot and avocado salad:Very delicious and highly recommended! The carrots are cooked perfectly and the dressing is a great balance. I will note that the complimentary bread wasn't my favorite. It fell short and was a bit dull. Otherwise- service was amazing, kind and attentive. Food was for the most part amazing, and the ambiance is beautiful. I would recommend trying this out."
Sandra L.,"Los Angeles, CA",6/7/2016,3 star rating,"This is a late review so I don't really have details anymore but I do remember walking out feeling like ""meh"". I was far more into peeking at the furniture store than I was about the food. This was my second time here with my first visit being some years ago but I feel like things have greatly declined. Server was not at all attentive, took a while to even get the check & table cleared. The plate that I received was chipped and scratched up. All in all, the decor is far more impressive than the food. Would only go back if invited, not by my own will. It's absolutely overhyped."
Shannon M.,"Puyallup, WA",1/7/2017,5 star rating,"This place was amazing. The food was absolutely delicious, but it was more than that. The whole experience was great. The decor, the fact that they use local artists to decorate with, local food. The waitress was very knowledgeable about how food was prepared. They were very efficient.We had reservations for 8 people for my friend's birthday. The staff was so attentive, and didn't mind us splitting the check. Absolutely loved this place, a great experience for my first time in NYC."
Jhia L.,"Manhattan, NY",3/12/2014,5 star rating,"WOW!Decor is amazing. Service is quick, staff is accommodating and pleasant. Presentation is wonderful.Taste is so flavorful and unique! I brought my brother here for his birthday and we were debating between this place or a nearby steakhouse...very happy with our choice. Pricing may seem expensive but won't once you receive your food.Calamari is crispy but not overcooked and is delicious with their housemade habanero hot sauce. I had the black sea bass...the broth was so good I was considering drinking it! The fish itself was soft and flavorful, but the akin had a little crunch to it. The spinach and small potatoes were sitting in the broth and really soaked up the taste. My brother had the cheeseburger and was equally impressed (I thought the Patty part was much thicker than I usually see). I stole a few of his fries and could instantly taste the truffle oil and the rosemary.We both left feeling full but not stuffed. Great portion sizes. I usually worry that really expensive places with unique items will have small portions. This place had enough for you to clean your plate and not feel guilty or cheated.We didn't get to taste these items but saw them on others plates and thought they looked fantastic: fried chicken, seasonal donuts, lobster, raw scallop appetizer, cooked scallop entree."
Eugene T.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",9/28/2018,5 star rating,"ABC Kitchen NEVER disappoints. The cocktail menu is fabulous. The tastiest menu items that I order religiously are the Garlic Crab Toast and the Roasted Beets! You can't go wrong with these as a starter. Then, once your food panic has subsided, and FOMO is out the window, you can select one of their amazing mains! I have never had a bad meal here....and I have been about 8 times just this year. Enjoy!! Also, great crowd of people. Upmarket yet not offensive. Great for a date!"
Diana C.,"Queens, NY",4/19/2013,3 star rating,"I can't tell if they just wanted to make us wait for the sake of waiting or if there were that many people late to their reservations because there were many empty tables - that irked me.Nonetheless we stuck it out. We sat allllll the way in the back in the reject seat (they said they save it for walk ins, which is what we were).  It was kinda cool because you saw ABC carpet and home store through the gates, they are connected in the back. Thankfully out reject seats were actually pretty cool. See photo. Felt pretty fancy.We got:Pretzel dusted calamari - didn't taste the pretzel at all, just tasted like regular calamari. Skip.Mushroom pizza - foodgasm! This was so so good. Flavors were amazing. I would come back just to eat this.Suckling - it was ok.... But we were also pretty stuffed from the pizza. I'd probably skip thisService was good and decor is very nice.Overall, I had high expectations, which I feel are justified when it is a Jean-Georges restaurant. Other than the pizza, the other two dishes did not leave an impression on me."
Amanda M.,"Seattle, WA",3/9/2016,3 star rating,"Came here on a busy Friday night with my boyfriend and ordered the crab toast, the tuna, a salad and the Kasha and Bowtie Pasta with Veal MeatballsFirst, lets get the bad out of the way. We both thought the Kasha and Bowtie Pasta with Veal Meatballs was pretty gross. My date is from Italy, so not a stranger to pasta. Idk what it was, the kasha was an odd texture to have with pasta, but that might have been our fault in ordering. The flavor was really odd/strong as well. I would NOT recommend this dish. EW.Now, for the good! The atmosphere is fun and open. The service is awesome.The crab toast, and tuna in ginger sauce were both good but not outstanding. All in all, I would try ABC Kitchen again. This time with NO KASHA."
Ken G.,"San Francisco, CA",3/4/2013,4 star rating,"Overall, this was a great experience in New York City.I'd heard a lot about this spot and was looking forward to being impressed.  The décor is a bit nicer and more interesting at night when the lights are dimmed...during the day, it still looks cool, but not as great.  Either way, it does not take away from the very good food:-Chicken Liver Toast - this was a very tasty and rich way to start the meal - sinful fattiness from the liver and a nice sweetness from the accompanying jam.-Spinach/Goat Cheese/Herb Pizza - a satisfying dish with very good flavor.  While I wasn't particularly blown away by the pizza, it was very good and had a nice fresh flavor to it.-Sundae - a great way to end the meal, I was really looking forward to the mix of salty/sweet and popcorn/pretzels all topped with chocolate...I really enjoyed it.-Chocolate Cake - This was a great, deeply chocolatey cake...the malted chocolate ganache was unique and I really liked the marshmallow frosting.This was a great restaurant and the first restaurant I've really enjoyed in New York in a long time.  Most of my restaurant experiences have been disappointing with many looking great, but offering mediocre food.  This place offered a hip and cool atmosphere as well as great plates.  It's very popular so be prepared with a reservation or be prepared to wait!"
Danielle M.,"San Fernando Valley, CA",2/17/2013,5 star rating,"This place really earned 5 stars for me! I have walked by it before and had numerous people recommend it to my boyfriend and I. We happened to be in Union Square on a chilly Thursday night recently and were hungry. So without a reservation at 5:30 we were lucky enough to get a table for two.  We sat close to the doors so it was a bit chilly every time the doors opened, but that is my ONLY complaint!  Every element about this space is fantastic and beautifully decorated! We were a little disappointed that it seemed everyone else around us was served bread but we did not get any. So I am not sure if you had to ask or not. On to the food.....we ordered the Chicken Liver Toast as a starter..It was delicious and very rich.  The butternut square pistachios dish was very tasty.I ordered the Homemade Ricotta Ravioli and it was so so scrumptious. It was simple and very flavorful.My boyfriend ordered the Spinach Goat Cheese Whole Wheat Pizza which was exceptional.For the finale we ordered dessertWe decided to split THE SUNDAE and was it a sundae, I would fly in to NY anytime just to have this delicious bowl of sweetness....you can't go wrong with Salted Caramel Ice Cream, Candied Peanuts and Popcorn, topped with Whipped Cream on a bed of Chocolate Sauce!! OH MY GOODNESS! GIVE ME MORE! 5 stars all the way"
Christine K.,"Bergen County, NJ",7/27/2014,5 star rating,"Worth the hype as long as you like the description of what you're ordering. Booked a table a month in advance for 5:45 on a Friday. I loved the ambiance and decor as soon as walking in. We knew we wanted the crab toast and chose to get the kasha and bow tie pasta with veal meatballs and the fried organic chicken as well. Everything was delicious and the menu is expansive enough that it's worth a trip back as well. It took us a bit of time to get the attention of a waiter to take our order, but it may have been cause it was a long week and neither of us were in the mood to obnoxiously wave someone down. The service otherwise was awesome-- they split each dish into two plates and served them that way because they magically knew that we were planning in sharing all the dishes anyway. Pretty great."
Josh W.,"Heath, OH",10/15/2017,3 star rating,"We met some friends for brunch at 11. There was a line of customers waiting to get in at 10:30. Good sign. Space is well organized, clean and airy. Service was very good. Menu was pretty standard with few exceptions. I ordered eggs, potatoes and side of bacon. Portion sizes are small. Eggs were gross and spicy for some reason. Potatoes were over cooked. Bacon was delicious. Coffee was very good. Company was great which made up for a disappointing meal."

Suki C.,"Manhattan, NY",4/11/2016,5 star rating,Awesome lunch date with my girlfriend :) I've heard many good words about this place but haven't had a time to check it out until last week. The ambiance was very chic and the food was absolutely delicious. I had a grilled chicken with quinoa and crispy kales. Yum Yum Yum!
Ahmad A.,"Atlantic City, NJ",9/19/2018,3 star rating,Service is good food is nice but the verity is very low ! Not so much to choose from!
Somin Y.,"San Francisco, CA",2/28/2013,5 star rating,"I really love ABC Kitchen!! So impressed. This place definitely met my expectation and actually even exceeded it.Reservation is MUST as this place is so popular that its spot are fileld out very quickly. I always come for Sunday brunch, sometime in the morning or sometime later at 2pm-ish. My review is based on their weekend brunch menu. First, look at the drink menu before moving into the food menu. Their cocktail list is really great; especially its Bloody Mary is dangerously delicious as much as I can say this is the best in the city! I just crushed with their Bloody Mary and had as many as THREE glasses for one Sunday brunch!!! Appetizer/salad - Crab Toast with lemon aioli: fresh but not amazingly impressive. - Raw Diver Scallops with lemon verbena: this was also fresh but not amazing. Should go well with white wine. - Roast Carrot And Avocado Salad with crunchy seeds, sour cream and citrus: Now I agree with all of the hypes about this salad at Yelp. Yes, this is MUST-EAT at ABC kitchen. You can feel what ""Organic dish"" truly is.Brunch entree- Smoked salmon: TO DIE FOR! One of the best smoked salmon dish in manhattan, I would dare say. Really fresh and flavorful. It's perfect to have with white wine.- Housemade Ricotta Ravioli herbs and tomato sauce: I really loved this dish. You can choose either 4 or 6 pieces. Truly handmade, substantially filled with soft ricotta cheese. Their tomato sauce can't be compared to other italian places in manhattan. - Spinach goat cheese and herbs pizza: The dough is very yammy. Goat cheese in great quality and flavor. So fresh spinach. Impeccable. - Mushrooms parmesan with farm egg pizza: It was okay but too much mushrooms which smell very strong so that I can hardly taste/enjoy parmesan cheese and egg. **Tip - ABC kitchen makes their own organic tomate ketchup. Ask your server to bring this ketchup and dip the pizza dough in it. Pretty good combination.Dessert- Salted caramel ice-cream MUST TRY!!! Their lemon sorbet is also amazing. ABC Kitchen is obviously my go-to spot for sunday brunch with cocktail!"
Aldana A.,"Manhattan, NY",9/17/2016,5 star rating,"We there with a friend. Loved the food and the service!We ordered mushroom pizza, crab toast and avocado and roasted carrot salad. All were great. I especially loved the mushroom pizza it was excellent!I'd go there again for sure"
Eric C.,"New York, NY",11/2/2019,1 star rating,"A month ago we went to ABCV.  All the food there was subtle and tasty.  ABC Kitchen is anything but subtle.  The Kale salad was overpowered by the dressing. The fettuccine was quite good and the salmon might've been delicious if you could taste it through the red cabbage, apple mustard that destroyed your taste buds. And it is noisy.  For the money you can do better almost anywhere."
Stacey C.,"Summit, NJ",2/15/2013,5 star rating,"How come it took me so long to get here?Because getting a reservation is like winning the lottery.We got 5:30 on a Tuesday.  Beggars can't be choosers.This is my new FAVORITE restaurant in the city.The staff is friendly, no attitude here.   Beautiful space in one of my favorite stores.........the food is wonderful, with a changing seasonal farm to table menu.Mix and match artisan and antique china, really fun.Food is the star here:We had the roasted carrot salad w/ avocado.....LOVED.Kale salad w/ jalapenos............Tuna sashimi w/ ginger broth..............Whole wheat pizza w/ dates and ricotta...........Cavatelli w/ rabbit ragu................Ginger cake w/ lemon frosting..................LOVED it all.Great cocktails and there is a nice big bar area for walk ins, so go last minute, I am sure you can score a seat.LOVED this place and can't wait to go back!"
Charlie R.,"Englewood, NJ",10/12/2015,2 star rating,"Came here for a family birthday brunch at 2pm on a Sunday. The space is beautiful and our table was nice and spacious! It took a while for us to get service, both for preliminary drinks and for food, but when our server was around he was very friendly and offered great recommendations to my family members. My reasons for knocking a few stars is that i (annoyingly) have celiac disease and so need to be extra careful about my gluten allergy. The server didn't seem to know whic items were gluten free (which is fine, it can be a lot to remember!) so I asked him to check on a few things before ordering. Then these things I asked him to check on simply came out with the rest of our food. When i asked a runner if an item was gluten free he said ""ummmmm yes?"" i asked ""are you sure"" and he said ""no. I can check."" I ended up being too nervous about whether or not my food was safe for me to eat to actually eat much/enjoy eating here. However, my other family members absolutely loved it. Moral : if you have allergens, maybe not the best place to go. If not, this place seems delicious!"
Lisa D.,"Los Angeles, CA",11/29/2015,4 star rating,"I guess I'm not giving a five, because I had heard so much about this place that I was expecting something out of this world. But, nonetheless, they deserve 4 or more stars because despite the fact that it was a very busy day with full reservations, the staff was incredibly kind to my friend and I and seated us right away at a table that they managed to put together. The kobocha squash toast was yummy and the snapper was light and highly recommended. Enjoy!"
Wendy K.,"New York, NY",2/20/2016,5 star rating,"Lunch always great there. Managed to get a last minute 2pm weekday reservation. Love that this place is easy and casual and everything on the menu is great! Although the pre-fixe option is tempting, I recommend ordering and sharing with friends. The portions are reasonable and in some cases more than average, so it's perfect for sharing and you're able to try more items on the menu!"
New Yorker N.,"New York, NY",9/7/2016,5 star rating,"Fantastic, healthful and nourishing food at ABC Kitchen.Dislikes: hard to get a table! Unless you like eating at 5:15pm or 10:15pm...!I'd come in much more frequently if it was easier to obtain a table last minute, but alas, it is what it is!This is the place that got me hooked on beets. I love it! Beautiful restaurant also."
Echo L.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",5/15/2016,5 star rating,"Superb. If you can get a table then grab it. Everything is super delicious. I highly recommend it. Great room. Great food. Great people watching. You can't go wrong. A little pricy but hey, look at all you're getting."
Michelle S.,"Toronto, Canada",5/11/2015,5 star rating,"I came here with 2 girlfriends a few weeks ago for dinner. It was amazing. We absolutely LOVED everything about ABC Kitchen from the whimsical decor to the delicious food. We had:Roast Carrot salad - 5/5 the roast carrots are so flavourful!Pizza with mushrooms - 5/5 I can't remember the exact name of this pizza but it had 2 kinds of mushrooms and it was incredible. tuna sashimi, scallop sashimi- both were  5/5. Fresh and delicious. My friends had the sea bass I think, and they loved it.For dessert we had the cookie plate. Honestly, go to ABC Kitchen. Particularly if you're a group of women. We felt this menu really catered to a female palate. I hope to return next time I'm in town. Also, I suggest making a reservation. I made mine several weeks in advance."
Sean S.,"Savannah, GA",3/26/2018,5 star rating,Some of the best food in NYC. Make sure to get a reservation cause the place is very popular. Any of the pasta dishes are incredible. Ravioli was a person favorite. Sea bass was on point. 7 dollar IPAS too. Cant go wrong with this place
Michelle H.,"Watertown, CT",7/5/2018,5 star rating,Incredible farm to table food! Waitress was on point with all dishes and recommendations even though they had 8 new menu items that night. Atmosphere was phenomenal and I will definitely come back here and recommend it to others!
Adrienne R.,"Manhattan, NY",2/12/2016,4 star rating,"I (and the rest of Manhattan) love ABC Kitchen. The inside decor is amazing, the ambiance is incredible and the food isn't bad either ; ) My absolute go to's are as follows -1. Crab toast - read any other reviews and undoubtedly they praise this amazing little dish. I don't know how they do it! It never disappoints. 2. The beets! Sounds so boring but they do it exactly right with the tangy yogurt sauce 3. The mushroom cracked egg pizza - this is amazing.  Truly amazing I also really like the carrot/avocado salad and the pesto/pea pasta - but you can't go wrong with any of the aforementioned three!"
ashley d.,"San Francisco, CA",11/1/2018,5 star rating,"Always a wonderful meal! I can't visit New York without coming here. Their lobster is to die for and the salads have wonderful flavor with great texture. There are other fish on the menu that look equally delectable, so I hope to come back soon and try some of the other meals. The atmosphere is also adorable and cozy and the waiters are very attentive and sweet without being overly friendly. Thanks for a great, memorable meal as usual!"
Larry F.,"Carmel, IN",7/3/2016,5 star rating,"First of all let me say that my wife surprised me for my 60th birthday with a trip to New York City. And after a Broadway show we had reservations at ABC kitchen. We found the entire experience to be fantastic. The craft drinks were cool and refreshing for summer.  For starters we had the highly recommended crab toast and the tuna shasimi  in ginger and mint which were both delicious and thoroughly enjoyable. Our waitress, summer, overheard us talking about the fettuccine with English peas and pesto and how was just too much food along with their entrées. She surprised us by bringing it out to us in a small portion size. It was to die for.  For our entrees, My wife  had the hake and I had the red snapper.  Both were amazing.  With no room for dessert we still ordered the chocolate cake because after all it was my birthday. Overall a wonderful experience."
Caroline T.,"Brisbane, Australia",1/8/2016,4 star rating,"I came here for lunch on a weekday in a group of three. Firstly, it is a large space but it is beautifully designed. The lighting is perfect, the tables well spaced and the decor is charming. It makes for a great atmosphere for couples and groups alike.So, food: we had the tuna sashimi, avocado and carrot salad and three different pizzas. They were all delicious especially the salad. The pizzas are wholewheat and fairly small in diameter but come with a lot of topping and we found them really filling. I love the farm to table dining theme; there were many other things I would have liked to try!Our service was friendly and efficient.All in all, it was a lovely experience and definitely worth a return trip. I would advise making a reservation. In fact, that is the main downside of dining here: reservations for dinner need to be made weeks in advance. Nonetheless, I look forward to my next visit."
Chris H.,Hong Kong,6/29/2011,4 star rating,"The fact that ABC Kitchen is backed by Jean-George Vongerichten somehow didn't dawn upon my dining partner (a well read and well fed foodie) until half way through the meal.  We'd finished swooning over a sweet, dreamy pile of crab with lemon aioli ($15), slapped onto good crusty bread; and we were all smiles after taking down a flavor bomb of plump housemade chicken sausages with potatoes, radish and grain mustard ($15).  ""You know"", I casually mentioned between mouthfuls of that good crab toast, ""this is by far my favorite Jean George backed restaurant"".  My dining companion was incredulous - ""he owns this place?  I had no idea... there's no Asian fusion bullshit on the menu?!"".  Well, there *was* a superb preparation of tuna sashimi calibrated with yuzu and mint ($16), that was so good that a little asian fusion ""bullshit"" could be tolerated.Mr. Vongerichten and his Chef de Cuisine, Dan Kluger's menu thankfully strays from the usual de rigueur of Asian fusion, as well as tiny portions, dainty food piled high, and decorated with elaborate swirls of sauce from a squeeze bottle.  Instead, it's seasonal, border-less food with big clean flavors, and often generous in portion.  And mercifully, they also don't resort to the peevish corn pone feel good comfort food trend which has crept into the other self proclaimed ""local, seasonal and eco-friendly"" restaurants in the city.However, there were a few misfires.  A cavatelli with guanciale, ramps, spring vegetables ($24) was filmy with an unappetizing layer of oil, and the pasta was grievously undercooked.  And a spendy but bland and diminutive lobster tail ($37) baked in a wood oven, arrived unadorned save a wedge of lemon - lamentably simple as A-B-C instead of the usual pizazz of J-G V.It would be a shame not to mention the appealing dining room - a shim sham clutter of beautiful furniture (this *is* a furniture store of sorts, lest we forget), beautiful chandeliers and beautiful people.  But with food that is good, and sometimes great even, the aesthetics take a back seat.  And sometimes so does the fact that this is a Jean-George Vongerichten restaurant."
Amy S.,"Westerville, OH",3/21/2016,5 star rating,"Overall amazing brunch and fabulous atmosphere...the restaurant decor is just perfect! All of the brunch entrees sounded wonderful..I ended up with the French toast which was the perfect amount of fried on the outside and warm and soft on the inside. I will say, the fruit plate was a little sparse and not great for sharing but the eggs Benedict we shared made up for it. Would love to go back again and again!"
Cassy S.,"Brooklyn, NY",8/27/2010,4 star rating,"I happily rolled out of ABC Kitchen last Friday night. It was one of those perfect NY dining experiences. The service was impeccable. The food was very good across the boards.  I got to sample even more dishes this time around. Again, I rolled outta that place...pants unbuttoned and all. No regrets really.I came here with my family to celebrate life - my new job and my sister surviving an accident. Perfect venue? I think so. Upon scanning the menu, I realized how it has already changed given I was just there a week prior. Guess I wont be reunited with roast pork tenderness after all *shrugs*  My mom gave me the go signal to select wine and plan out our meal.  She asked me which ones were good to which I replied ""every single savory dish is mom. Trust me.""  And she did. The result? A FEAST! Like kings and queens we enjoyed the following:Round 1: crostinis of peekytoe crab, chicken liver, heirloom tomatoes;  fluke carpaccio, roasted beets w yogurt, zucchini special. My fav: zucchini special, beets with yogurt, and heirloom tomato crostini. simple yet heavenly satisfying.Round 2: spinach with goat cheese pizza, mushroom pizza, mozzarella cheese w heirloom tomato and basil, roasted carrots and avocado salad, and a simple pasta dish w shrimp and tomatoes I forgot the name of. My fav: still the roasted carrot saladRound 3: (by this time my father jokingly asked to cancel the rest of our order) lambchops, broiled lobster, sea bass w spinach and potatoes, seared chicken with mashed potatoes, side of string beansMy fav: Chicken. Why? Because it was done perfectly. Moist and seasoned well...crispy skin and all. Round 4: We questioned whether we have space space for dessert. After eating this much, what's another bite of five right? We had sundae with salted caramel ice cream, strawberries w lime juice and poppyseed ice cream, warm doughnuts w dip and a cookie plate.  My pick: strawberries w poppyseed ice cream because it had a refreshing cleansing effect to end our meal.Everyone agreed with my earlier statement. Everything at ABC Kitchen is good.  Yummmaaayyy!P.S. My sister works here which allowed us to taste more dishes apart from the many we ordered. Big thanks!P.S.S. Chef Dan Kluger said one more visit and I become a regular. Ha!"
Jeff S.,"Boca Raton, FL",4/19/2012,2 star rating,"My love-hate relationship with ABC Kitchen continues. We showed up at 5:30pm, with a totally empty main dining room in front of us. After a few minutes, the hostess informed us that we had to sit in the 'cafe' (i.e. the hallway) just outside ABC itself because of other reservations. She said she didn't want to make us feel bad, but a lot of people were due to arrive at any minute.If this was my first time at ABC Kitchen, I wouldn't even notice. And, truth be told, I don't even care where I sit. But these people at the door deal the same lie every single time and they never ever fill up. Even after being told they were getting the bum rush, they still had at least 12 tables free (yes, I'm an ass, I counted) in the main room when we left.Being treated like a second class customer when I pay a $150 check leaves me with a pretty bad taste in my mouth. Some douchy hostess wants to hold tables for phantom superstars who never materialize? Oh, Justin Beiber may show up? This shitty attitude really makes me not want to eat here.I've never ever been treated like this at any other Jean Georges establishment, so I am sure it's the manager that's responsible for letting this kind of behavior exist. To the manager: F U buddy! I hope you're fired for sanctioning this kind of unprofessional behavior.That unpleasantness aside. AMAZING food. The suckling pig with smoked bacon marmalade was absolute paradise. The tuna tartare, with its vibrant ginger chili marinade, was excellent as usual.If you don't mind snobby hostesses who insist on talking to you like you're an infant and insulting seating and reservation practices, you should stop by here because the food is seriously good and worth every penny they charge."
J G.,"New York, NY",1/4/2017,5 star rating,"Came here for the second time and food was amazing! The waiter was so friendly and attentive. I had their buttermilk biscuit, scramble egg with fried oysters, pizza, and sea bass. You must try their pizza! Everything was perfect and I highly recommend this cute restaurant."
Jennifer C.,"COLLEGE POINT, NY",6/24/2015,5 star rating,"Been meaning to try this place for quite some time but reservations are difficult to come by. Luckily if you go in person and ask for a table, the wait appears to be shorter than expected. For example our hour wait ended up being only 15 to 20 minutes. Score!Food is tasty but definitely not cheap.Best appetizer had to be the crab on toast.The sashimi/raw items were yummy.For entrees, can't go wrong with the sea bass."
Fawn T.,"New York, NY",4/25/2015,5 star rating,This is one of my favorite restaurants! I come here at least once a year especially on my birthday. I highly recommend you make reservations a month in advance - this place books up fast! I recommend the Brussels sprouts and the cheese and fig plate. The sea bass is amazing also.
Bill S.,"Long Island, NY",7/25/2011,4 star rating,"I'm going to start this review by slamming another restaurant. If one more dopey Yelper says the Chicken Liver Toast is the best thing they ever ate at Spotted Pig in the West Village I'm gonna lose it. The Chicken Liver Toast at ABC Kitchen is ""to die for"" and is the best I ever ate. Ever. And on a hot summer night? I love sitting at Jean-Georges bar that looks like it was inspired by the John Lennon Imagine video and drinking a cucumber gin fizz. Last night I stopped in for quick bite. I ordered the Black Sea Bass with chilis and spinach. So fresh, so tasty, so French, so Jean-George.Love this place!"
Samantha S.,"New York, NY",3/10/2016,2 star rating,"I came here for brunch with friends who love ABC Kitchen. As someone who adores brunch in general, I looked forward to a real treat, seeing as how our reservation was booked 4 weeks in advance. Unfortunately, it was just an expensive blah. ABC Kitchen is trendy, sporting a rustic meets modern design (mismatched silverware and all), ironically set to a light 90s rap/R&B soundtrack. It's cute for sure. I stared and stared at the menu, with no idea what to order. Not because I couldn't decide due to so many options. I simply couldn't find anything that grabbed me. It all just seemed... uninteresting. I looked around to see what others were eating, and I found it underwhelming. We ordered donuts and cheddar biscuits for the table. At $10 for two tiny donuts, they'd better be amazing. They were fine, but nothing extraordinary- a theme that lingered throughout the meal. The cheddar biscuits were forgettable, and not served with the lemon curd they apparently complement, so I can't comment on that. We shared a mushroom and egg pizza, which was good, but not the taste explosion I had hoped for. Ultimately, I ordered the scrambled eggs and potatoes as my entree, which I never order anywhere, but I was that apathetic about the menu. The eggs were fine, I guess the best you can expect from a scrambled egg. The potatoes were bland and unseasoned. They went unfinished, and that's even with asking for Tabasco to add some taste. I didn't order dessert because I didn't see the point- $50 spent already for just myself, and I just didn't want to feel underwhelmed by another overpriced plate. Out of the 4 of us, just one person ordered dessert. All in all, service was good, and it's not bad at ABC Kitchen, but it's not what I would call good, and certainly not for a Jean George restaurant at steep prices."
BH K.,"Franklin, TN",6/20/2016,5 star rating,This place is so good that we planned our vacation around it. Stayed close to Union Square and just have a 9 minute walk to the restaurant.The amazing thing about the restaurant is that you can order anything on the menu and almost all the time the fresh vegetable sides will stand out and become the main character of the dish. It would convert anyone that does not like greens into believers. Service is impeccable to go with the very well thought of food pairings.
Wing L.,"Long Island, NY",11/9/2011,4 star rating,"As much as this place is hyped up, the atomosphere otherwise tells a different story.  Generally, I find over-hyped restaurants to be pretentious and the vibe uncomfortable.  ABC Kitchen is the antithesis, with warm, friendly staffs and a rustic ambiance that is inviting, with it's casual-elegant decor. Kudos to the use of organic ingredients and the environmentally friendly approach they utilize in their restaurant.   For lunch, I sampled the prix fixe menu ($28) and a few appetizers to share amongst my group.Appetizers:1. Crab Toast:  Definitely get this as a side!  The toast has generous chunks of crab piled high on toast.  Buttery (melts in your mouth!), sweet, and succulent- can I have my toast like this from now on?  Can't go wrong with this one.2. Raw diver scallops - Perhaps i was expecting whole scallops, like with Japanese places. Can you blame me? For 16 dollars, I get thin layer of scallops on a shell.  The grape pieces were bigger than the scallops itself.  it was seasoned well with lemon so it was like eating a ""thin"" ceviche but for the price you're paying for this dish, it's a bit much.  Maybe if I would have kept the shell?3. Line caught tuna sashimi with mint and ginger- This was good but quite frankly, I've had better tuna sashimi at Japanese restaurants for a fraction of the price.  Yes, it's organic so the price ($16) reflects it but just wanted to warn you that it's not really a plate meant for sharing. It had about 4 pieces of sashimi. The Prix fixe:1. Appetizer:  Roasted beets with house-made yogurt.  Ironic to say, this was my 2nd favorite appetizer.  There were 3 different types of beets with different shades of red.  The beets were sweet, soft, and complimented the tangy yogurt sauce.  It felt really fresh as if it was rightly plucked from the gardens. Loved it.2. Entree: Braised hake, which comes on a bed of green cabbage and other vegetables.  The fish was flaky and tender.  The fish was subtle in flavor but the cabbage was a bit on the salty side. It's best to eat it together so they compliment each other.3. Dessert was turnover cranberry cake, which was pretty good and came with plump cranberries.Overall, your best bet is probably the fixed price menu as you can sample a few dishes (and it saves money as oppose to ordering them individually).  Some of the sides are a little over priced if ordered individually so do note that they do come in small portions.  The rustic atmosphere though is calming and inviting and gives you a break from the hustle and bustle."
Amanda S.,"Brooklyn, NY",8/17/2018,4 star rating,"This classic Jean-Georges restaurant inside a high-end furniture store makes for a relatively ""clean"" meal, especially for lunch. Get the crab toast!"
Andie H.,"Toronto, Canada",9/2/2017,4 star rating,"I went to ABC kitchen with my friend for her birthday dinner, and we both totally adored it. The ambiance was great, everyone was very low-key stylish and goodlooking. Our waiter was charming and informative. Everything we ate was excellent and you could really taste the difference of the farm-to-table ingredients in every dish. Minus one star because when we showed up for our reservation, the hostess told us it had been cancelled (???) and that we'd have to wait in the bar for 25 mins for a table, and nobody ever apologized to us for their mistake. Luckily we didnt end up having to wait quite that long, and the food and wait staff made us forget all about it. Excited to return."
Taylor S.,"Los Angeles, CA",6/19/2016,5 star rating,"ABC Kitchen is such a cute place to dine, and it has a great vibe. I am from LA and I always make it here to have the best item...their crab toast! I am obsessed. It is in the list of the top 10 best dishes I've ever had. It is not fishy at all and all of the flavors complement each other perfectly to create the most outstanding dish. In fact, I loved it so much that I ordered a second one. I didn't even have to order anything else there because the crab toast is too perfect, I'm sure nothing could compare."
Lucy C.,"New York, NY",9/15/2017,2 star rating,"Came here this week during restaurant week but ordered off the regular menu. Had the tuna sashimi and the hake. Sashimi was drowning in sauce, which was too salty. Hake was good but not amazing. Sevice was slow and uncoordinated. Serving time was foreverrrrr. Caramel ice cream dessert was really good--very American. I recommend this dessert and to come here to a safe meal in modern, trendy ambiance. But for good food, try elsewhere."
Bing B.,"Portland, OR",10/14/2018,3 star rating,Oct 2018.Might have been an off night - been here before when food was more flavorful and service was a bit more on it's game.  Don't know that I will return with so many alternatives in the City
Sunia T.,"Manhattan, NY",3/11/2015,5 star rating,"My husband and I fell in love with ABC Kitchen and cannot wait to come back...whenever we can get another dinner reservation that is. There is a reason it is so hard to get reservations here.The ambiance was trendy yet intimate with dim lighting and modern light fixtures. I like to try a bit of everything so we had ordered various appetizers to start. The Sashimi, Crab Toast, and Calamari were all phenomenal. For our entrees, we had ordered the Black Sea Bass and Mushroom Pizza, again, both excellent dishes.The Salted Caramel Sundae definitely lived up to its hype and I can see why it had made so many yelp photo appearances. Also, they make a delicious cappuccino. We really cannot wait to come back and try more of their menu."
Alison H.,"Somerset, Somerset, NJ",6/17/2012,5 star rating,"ABC Kitchen was one of my most satisfying dining experiences EVER. I support the local food movement. Every single thing in the restaurant is recycled or purchased from a source like no other. No two pieces of silverware are alike, the bread bowls are made by the something something tribe, and the food is all locally sourced and responsibly grown. No pesticides no overcrowding etc. It does make me feel good to know my chicken had friends and possibly his own room....does not hurt that he was delish as well. Crab Toast 5/5Pizza with Asparagus and Bacon 100000/5 (Would rob an old lady for this)Snapper 4/5...only because I'm not crazy about mint.Chicken 5/5...How do they get the skin that crispy and flavorful??Almond Tart. 10000000/5...I seriously almost.....ya knowWe were stuffed and had plans to go out after so we initially declined dessert. The waitress recommended the almond tart saying that it was very light. I literally think this tart arrived to ABC floating on a little cloud. They allow reservations to be made 31 days in advance. I suggest furiously clicking on open table at midnight exactly 31 days ahead. I tried to get a reservation here 4 times with plans made first, I eventually resorted to just booking 31 days ahead then finding some to go with later. There is also no wait list until the day of. I will be back for sure. Hopefully many times.PS. Did Jean Georges really travel around the U.S. picking up dishes and silverware from garage sales??? I heard this haha."
Robb C.,"League City, TX",10/16/2015,4 star rating,"Atmosphere: very cool. A very diverse crowd; mostly couples, friends, and colleagues. Food: the crab toast was very tasty! Some parts of the toast were a little too rough for my liking but plenty of crab on the top!  The scallops was more like a ceviche, thin sliced, and a small portion. I wouldn't recommend them. The calamari was good. Breaded in pretzel dust which brought a unique change of taste. The lobster entrée was cooked perfectly and the broth was the best I've had. The side item of corn was great. They spiced it up nicely.Drinks: I got a Moscow Mule and it was pretty good. Normally served in a copper cup to enhance the flavor I'm told, but theirs in served in a normal glass. Generally, I think their drinks are expensive but what else is new in NYC. Service: There was an hour and half wait so we sat at the bar. We got pretty quick service there by both bartenders.Overall it was a cool spot and the food was good. I'd go back!"
Elizabeth K.,"Ann Arbor, MI",9/13/2015,4 star rating,"ABC Kitchen - came here with a friend on their recommendation. The space was lovely and airy, it felt a bit like being out in a garden, with whimsical shabby chic mismatched plates. Service was excellent - warm and attentive without being over the top.Food was thoughtful and fresh, but seemed rather overpriced for the portions. The stand-outs were the crab toast, the mushroom pizza with a farm egg (I think I started giggling uncontrollably from joy with this one - it was quite good), and the carrot avocado salad. Less interesting were the tuna sashimi (marinade was a bit on the sour/lime side, not enough of the soy ginger) and the biscuits (the cheddar did not come through). I also did like the mustard-y dressed summer beans with hazelnuts available as a side. For some reason the entrees did not really tempt. The cocktail list was very nice - thoughtful without being too complicated. We saw the doughnuts as we were walking out, and regretted not saving room!"
Mike V.,"San Francisco, CA",10/17/2012,5 star rating,"Last night in New York on that last trip,Might as well have been my ""last meal"".No denying it, ABC scored on every meal, and thank goodness there were 6 of us, and being the only American, I was happy to be surrounded by people who REALLY don't mind going family style.  We ended up closing the place out and being the last to drag ourselves out the door.Top hits?

Eva T.,"Palos Verdes Estates, CA",7/22/2015,4 star rating,Still yummy after all these years! Had lunch with the ladies and it was a fun and delicious experience. The check in for noon reservations was a little crazy (line to check in out the door) but once we were seated it was all good.  They had a 3 course pre-fix menu for $33 which one of the ladies ordered. I had the ramps and goat cheese toast and the raviolo special.  All super tasty!
Si N.,"New York, NY",6/13/2018,4 star rating,"My boyfriend and I tried this place for dinner on a weekday night. The atmosphere is really great, beautiful space. Service, however, wasn't very attentive. They were busy but still, it's not the weekend. Drinks took forever to get to us, but they were worth it! We had the crab toast, mushroom/farm egg pizza everyone is raving about and my boyfriend had the burger. As a vegetarian, I can't rave about the other two food items, but the pizza was divine! I could care less for the egg, but the crust and the abundance of mushrooms made it quite the experience. Yes I do get very excited for mushrooms. :) really good stuff! Recommend trying to cocktails. Overall, solid four stars."
Amelia C.,"New York, NY",5/11/2013,4 star rating,"When I looked up the menu online, and saw the headline of local and organic ingredients... I immediately thought that a dining experience at ABC Kitchen was going to veer towards the healthier side - to my surprise, my dinner here ended up being quite rich! It was tasty, and I loved the decor and ambiance. The restaurant is in a beautiful space, and the epitome of what I imagine coming together when the farm table is brought to the big city. In particular, I'd recommend the crab toast with lemon aioli and the pretzel dusted calamari. The mushroom and parmesan pizza was very rich, and I did not like the raw egg yolk that was in the center of it. Definitely on the pricier end, but in part you're paying for the experience of dining there."
Rachel B.,"Chicago, IL",4/16/2013,4 star rating,"Absolutely adorable restaurant!

There was a Bellini on the drink list that was incredible, order it!"
Jason G.,"Seattle, WA",4/12/2012,4 star rating,"The carrot and avocado salad was zesty, good mix of texture, and light (4 rating).  The housemade ricotta ravioli was tasty and the ricotta gave you that savory smack (4 rating).  The akaushi cheeseburger was okay, not that flavorful though tender, not that cheesy, and the fries were a bit soggy (3 rating).  The salted caramel sundae with candied peanuts and popcorn and chocolate sauce was too good to be shared, just kidding, it's a lot of calories and yummy but the perfect size for sharing (definitely a 5)."

Kate K.,"Manhattan, NY",11/13/2018,1 star rating,Remarkably poor service. Manager did ultimately apologize for waiter's errors but egregiously poor attention to detail. Third time going over the past few years and food is consistently over-salted.  Surprising given caliber of restaurant group. An aberration I hope they fix.
Lawrence V.,"Manhattan, NY",1/3/2015,5 star rating,"I wanted to wait before I wrote this review to make sure the magic of the evening had worn off and I could make as objective a review as possible. Funnily enough, a week later and the magic still hasn't worn off and I look back at my meal with longing. A yearly tradition has begun where for Christmas, I go out with my sister and brother-in-law for a nice dinner. This was absolutely no disappointment. The meal started with a glass of wine and some Mckenzie Rye. We followed with our first course, where we had a mushroom bread, ricotta with cranberry compote, a particular favorite of mine, a fluke crudo with dill, tuna sashimi, and a special pizza if the night, dates and prosciutto. After our first course, we relaxed for a few enjoyed another drink or two and moved on. Our entree was amazing. We had the red snapper, the fried chicken which was hands down the most moist and flavorful fried chicken i've ever tasted, the mushroom pizza with egg, and the lobster special with truffle butter glaze.  To finish the meal off, we had the ice cream sundae, which is designed to be a deconstructed snickers bar with salted caramel ice cream, chocolate sauce, peanuts, and caramel popcorn. In addition, our waiter sent out a piece of chocolate cheesecake. Usually, one or two items stands out as a defining dish of a meal. On the flip side, one or two items stands out as being slightly less or even not worth ordering. However, after enjoying the meal we had, I can honestly say, everything was top notch. Every dish was perfectly balanced and I found myself sad when the meal was over. Our waiter was another particular stand out. He was intelligent, informed, helpful, mindful of us and funny. He'd provide suggestions that weren't just trying to upsell the next item.  I couldn't speak and higher of my experience here if I tried. If you're considering going. Go.Overall Rating: A++"
Fey F.,"Santa Monica, CA",12/17/2014,3 star rating,"Good food, but horrible wine list.  All their wines are acidic or sour if not bitter with no body or complexity, not balanced. I ordered 3 of their wines including the $19 glass of red wine & all acidic or bitter. I'm a drinker & if wine is cheap I don't enjoy my food. You basically paying for ambiance & service but quality is lacking"
Wahed K.,"Queens, NY",8/9/2012,3 star rating,"Food: 3.5 to 4 starsService: 3 starsValue: 3 starsMy wife and I arrived promptly for our 7:30 pm resos on a Tuesday. We waited about 15 minutes before we were seated - not terrible but not great either. Once seated, we didn't need more than a couple of minutes to decide what we wanted. It took them another ten minutes to notice that we were ready to order. I was starting to complain about the service to my wife but it got better from that point onwards. We got the crab toast, cavatelli pasta with shrimp, tomatoes & chili flakes, lobster and the suckling pig. There were some definite high notes. The crab was very fresh and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente even though the sauce was a bit on the salty side. I also appreciated the quality and the freshness of the tomatoes in the pasta. The lobster on the other hand simply failed to impress and though the suckling pig had a bit too much sweetness for my taste, the skin was crisped to absolute perfection.We had told our waiter that we wanted to share the dishes so they split up the pasta and the lobster in separate plates for us. That made up for their slow start.I had been wanting to come to ABC Kitchen for a while and was really looking forward to our dinner. In then end, I found myself wondering if it had been worth it. Our 4 dishes + 3 glasses of wine came to $90 per person with t&t. That's not too bad for Jean Georges restaurant but while the food was good, I didn't find it quite as amazing as I had hoped for."
hannah k.,"Los Angeles, CA",7/30/2017,5 star rating,Tasty food with great service. My friend and I dinned here and asked the waitress to surprise us with meals. We told her our limitations and she delivered the best dishes.

Jeanette L.,"New York, NY",5/19/2011,4 star rating,"Adorable!! The decor inside is perfection and the food was really tasty! Here's a breakdown of what we shared:Crab Toast w/Lemon Aioli - holy amazing this shit is the BOMB. i'm not even a huge crab lover and it's amazing. be sure to use the lemon wedges they give you on the side. the citrus REALLY makes the dish.Mushroom/Parmesan/Oregano/Farm Egg Pizza - this was REALLY good. love the egg (runny) over the pizza and the flavor and consistency is spot on. Pretty rich though, FYI.My bro got the Prix Fixe ($25, GREAT price!):Roasted Beets w/Housemade Yogurt - Oh heck yes. This was oober delicious. The yogurt is perfection. The balsamic/olive oil is a nice twist and actually compliments the yogurt really well...aka PARTY IN YOUR MOUTH! Nom.Braised Short Rib entree - brother really liked this, meat was tender and flavorful. i thought it was a tad on the salty side but he devoured it.AND NOW ONTO THE DESSERT --- drum roll --- salted caramel ice cream + candied peanuts + popcorn + whipped cream + chocolate sauce this shit should be illegal. it. was. DELICIOUS. SUPER rich (hello, did you read what it is?) but totally worth it. Just be sure you have a full glass of water at the start! MUST try. My other thing is, you can tell it's not like AMAZINGGG ice cream (trust me, there is a difference). i think if they partnered with an AMAZING ice cream place, this dessert would rank in my top 5 ever. so, overall, a must try place. it's adorable, the food is great and the prices aren't outrageous. only complaint, that while our waitress was adorable and super nice, service was KIND OF slow. we had a 230 reservation and it was pretty crowded when we got there but by the time we were waiting around for quite a while for our dessert/bill, there was barely anyone there and it was taking foreverrrrr. but she was nice so i guess it kind of balances it out."
A D.,"New York, NY",2/6/2013,4 star rating,"One of my favorite place in the Flatiron area. Good for lunch on weekdays, in particular if you work in fashion, art, music industries. In the evening, it's a perfect place for bringing a date, or a group of (20's or 30's) friends. Getting a table in the evening without a reservation is possible, but you maybe asked to wait at the bar, for an hour / an hour-and-half. If you decide to eat by the bar or on the few tables around the bar, it's quicker, but nosier, and you will miss the decor of the all white / barn dining room.In Winter, they proposed a special white truffle pizza for  US 140, delicious but a little bit too small. Otherwise, the food is very good, with vegan options, farm-to-table style.Enjoy it all, including the desserts !"
Brad M.,"Mercer Island, WA",2/17/2016,5 star rating,"Fantastica, The vibe, feel, amospere, energy and food are all great. It's almost hard to find as its low key on the outside, but inside it's pretty special. Food was great from crab toast to carrot salad to calamari. We ordered stuff and just shared it all. Server was good but a little pretentious, but it's NY so what do you expect."
Alison M.,"Washington, DC",7/27/2018,2 star rating,"Overall disappointing experience, and that is excluding the price. Had been to abc v and abc cocina so was looking forward to the dinner but this was by far the worst of the three. 1. Service was poor. Waiter was inattentive and unfriendly after having to flag him down after long periods of time waiting to order 2. Food was subpar. We even took waiters suggestion on the favorite pasta dish. I am not picky with pasta and it should be an easy crowd pleaser but both my boyfriend and I found it pretty poor. 3. We were there for my boyfriends birthday. I mentioned this to the waiter AND both hostesses. I was told they'd bring a cupcake and candle. We lingered for a while but eventually gave up. When I mentioned this to the hostess on the way out, he looked confused despite having just discussed this an hour prior and having watched him jot a note by our reservation listing"
Rose W.,"Brooklyn, NY",2/20/2013,3 star rating,"For a classy dine-in restaurant, I expect high quality foods with superb taste. And although ABC provides great quality, the taste always seemed to be on the strong, pungent side. We came in with a table reserved for 20 people, and with a set-menu of approx 3 drinks per person, the total turned out to be about $140 per person. I liked that they provided small portions of a enormous variety of foods, so I felt pretty satisfied with both the variety and amount of food we got. Here's what we got and my ratings:AppetizerHousemade ricotta with grilled bread: 4/5. I LOVED the ricotta, it was SO good that I wanted to put it on everything! The ricotta itself was one of my fav items of all the appetizers, but this dish was RUINED by the 'grilled' bread, which was actually SCORCHED rather than grilled. It was so black at the edges that it gave the bread a very bitter taste. Crab toast with lemon aioli: 2/5. The lemon is much too strong and sour. It ruined the sweet taste of the crab.Roasted beets with housemade yogurt: 2/5. The roasted beets was good, but I still can't figure out why they decided to put it on top of the yogurt, which was very acidic. It doesn't help that the beets sweet so that the yogurt tasted more sour. Those two just DID NOT complement each other well. Raw scallops: 3/5. I prefer SLIGHTLY cooked scallop over raw scallop, because raw scallop has no taste whatsoever. However they did well in adding the right spices to make it taste fine. Overall, meh. Tuna sashimi: 3/5. Again, another 'meh' item. The tuna lacked the buttery taste that I usually find in tuna sashimi.Roasted butternut squash: 5/5!! My FAV of the entire appetizer. It was simple yet delicious. No extravagant spices that clashed on the palate. Mushroom, Parmesan, egg pizza: 2/5. I love mushroom pizza, I love egg, and I love parmesan. But together on a thin burnt crust just = no bueno. A bit too heavy for my taste. Entree:Roast pig: 4/5. I really enjoyed the sweet onions on top, and the tenderness of the pork. They even left a nice crispy skin on the very top layer that tasted like bacon. However the sauce was just too overwhelming. I wished they would just use the basic juices from the roast pig as the base, but again, everything about French food is all about STRONG tastes, so the sauce was again too flavorful. The presentation was nice though.  Side: Roasted brussel sprouts: 3/5. WHY do they SMOKE everything so that it's scorched?! I understand if you lightly burn meat or bread in the grilling or toasting process, but seriously vegetables too?! I like my veggies fresh and cooked as little as possible to retain their vitamins, thanks.Dessert:Chocolate cake: 2/5. Too sweet. Unless you're a dark-chocolate lover then you may just like it. Otherwise, too bitter for my taste. Red wine poached pear with hazelnut ice cream: 4/5. The pear was very tasty, but I could only do about 3 bites of it and then I'm done. I give them props for using red wine in making a very unique and creative sauce. However, they should have just drizzled it over the pear rather than DROWN the entire thing. The hazelnut ice cream, on the other hand, was DELICIOUS!Seasonal doughnuts: what can I say, they're donuts! They taste like normal donuts, but with more dough. Not your usual-light-krispy-kreme donuts and much better quality than your store-bought-packaged hostess crap. I've got high standards if you're going to charge $140 per person. Cost must equate to quality! GREAT table settings though- I loved the candles and the fresh flowers, but terrible furniture. I was sitting on white plastic lawn chairs that my coat kept slipping off of because it was so shiny and hard and well, plastic-y. Perhaps some of those fancy antler-looking decor should have been converted into coat hangers, because those chairs were certainly not high enough to keep my coat off the ground (when it DID hang), and trust me, I'm a short gal!"
Chris S.,"Newport Beach, CA",1/4/2018,4 star rating,"We've been looking forward to ABC Kitchen for quite some time.  Overall very positive experience.  The food was excellent although the portions were a little small.  I highly recommend the fried chicken in ""hot sauce butter"", yum.  Wine selection was a little light but the wine prices were reasonable."
Tammy P.,"West Palm Beach, FL",5/27/2018,5 star rating,This is by far the best meal in New York and I've eaten at some really high end restaurants. Everything was fabulous from the service to the food. When visiting New York I'll be sure to eat every dinner here.
Alysha J.,"Manhattan, NY",7/3/2015,5 star rating,This restaurant is not a quick in and out if you truly want to experience all that they have to offer. First start with their in house made beverages which the nonalcoholic are just as good as the alcoholic! You must start with the crab appetizer which leaves your mouth craving more. The grilled shrimp is sautéed to perfection. The service is the best that I have seen in NYC. They are very attentive and really know the pairings to your meal selection which adds to the overall experience.
Yunhee L.,"Flushing, NY",3/27/2016,5 star rating,"Absolutely amazing!!!! Wonderful atmosphere. Beautiful place to be with your loved ones. The service was excellent, very welcoming & friendly.On to the food!! We hadMushroom & farm egg pizza- must have!Pear & apple salad- very unique & refreshingCrab toast - best best!!!!Oh~~ definitely will come back!!!!"
Nancy C.,"Manhattan, NY",8/6/2015,2 star rating,"Ordered:Two Kelp Salads with chicken added and a shared Beet/Yogurt App...throw in ONE Lemonade and ONE Iced Tea and you've spent nearly $100.!!!!Insane!  What a got was a plate of greens, slightly dressed, with a tiny chicken breast and about 4 slices of Beet with a dollop of Yogurt!Left hungry and unfulfilled! The food was barely flavorful and does not at all warrant the ridiculously high price!Went around the corner when I was done and picked up some absolutely DELICIOUS Empanadas from Spohie's on 23rd for $2.60 EACH!Tasted better than anything I ate here and at a fraction of the Price.Won't be going back 'cause it's like throwing $100. bills out the window!So displeased....."
Mauricio R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",9/17/2017,1 star rating,Not even a 1 star is worth. Service was horrible. Waited 45 for a table when there was over 6 tables open. And waited for over 20 mins after ordering our food and still never got it. Total disappointment. Had no choice but to walk out. McDonald's had better service.
Nicole D.,"New York, NY",10/16/2012,5 star rating,"It's been a while since I've been to a restaurant that actually lived up to the expectations set by the reviews and press.  I truly enjoyed everything I had and tasted and feel that this is one of the best restaurants in the city right now.  Finally, a place that I was happily satisfied with and believe is worth it.A few items that we had:- Roasted okra and shishito peppers - wood oven roasted with lots of seasoning to keep it simple but tasty- Raw diver scallops - one of my favorites of thinly sliced scallops dressed with lime and chilies that complemented the scallops and didn't overwhelm- Roast suckling pig - so delicious and moist, the pig is presented elegantly as a rectangular shape with enough crispy skin for every bite which is not always the case- Sundae - we had a hard time deciding, but went with the sundae to share for the table.  It hit the spot with the salted caramel ice cream and crunch from the peanuts.Beautiful space, great food, wonderful dining experience."
Marvin H.,"Brooklyn, NY",7/13/2017,5 star rating,"Been on my Yelp list for about 4 years but finally got to go to dinner here only recently. The decor was eccentric, the service was great and the food was really well done. I really enjoyed the spinach/goat cheese pizza and my salmon entree. Wine selection was also really great. I will certainly be coming back."
Chris C.,"Hoboken, NJ",9/2/2019,5 star rating,"Friendly service, beautiful decor and delicious food!  The card toast was very flavorful with a great balance of crisp, meat and acid.  The pasta were good and perfectly seasoned - not too salty and heavy like most restaurants.  Fish is always so good!  It's been around for a while but still high quality Jean Gorges establishment!"
Fatima A.,"Anthem, Las Vegas, NV",3/20/2016,5 star rating,"This is part of my NY bucket list and I finally got the chance to try this place.  It didn't disappoint.  We had the jalapeño cheeseburger, crab toast and the wild mushroom  wheat pizza with Parmesan, oregano and farm egg. All amazing.  And the service is awesome!!!"
Sofiya K.,"Boston, MA",3/3/2017,3 star rating,"Over-rated. Heavy handed with salt. We both ordered the  seabass over spinach. It came with a good amount of spinach water. We also ordered the marinated olives and the portobello apps. The Portobello was  also heavy handed with salt. We got a side of mashed potatoes which were good, but also heavily salted, and also had some water in the bowl. The hipster chairs were very uncomfortable in the short time that we were there. The menu was clipped to a piece of cardboard. When we got our coats from coat check they were freezing. Did they keep them outside? When we left, my husband said he was still hungry. In the end - over-rated, hipster restaurant that I would not come back to or recommend."
Lierh L.,"Manhattan, NY",7/8/2014,4 star rating,"The environment is nice although it was a little bit noisy. The waiter and waitress were friendly and helpful. They didn't push us to order.About the food here, we both like the salad and salmon sashimi toast. The salad was tasty and the salmon was fresh and sweet. But the lemon chiffon cake doesn't taste lemon much. We will try another dessert next time. Overall, we enjoyed the meal there. :)"
Isabel L.,"New York, NY",2/10/2011,4 star rating,"wow... so after hearing SO MUCH help about ABC kitchen for over months..I was finally able reserve a table at 6pm on a Monday via Opentable..I realized that the restaurant was actually extremely spacious and there were a bunch of tables open.. because of that I suggest that if you're gonna come early ( 6ish) you should just walk in and snatch a tableDecor: The main dining room is gorgeous but I wouldn't have dinner in the bar area. The door kept opening and closing ..must hv been freezing out there.Among appetizers:- Pretzel dusted calamari ( adds a ilttle oomph to the regular calamari)- whole wheat clam pizza ( its a winner ! super thin crust, light yet tasty)Ranking among the fish entrees1) Crunchy roasted chatham cod ( Those mushrooms were amazing and the breadcrumbs works wonder on the cod. My favorite! )2)Slow cooked Arctic Char ( Good and I love the carrots)3)Sea bass ( dry and was my least favorite)Dessert:Pear Bread Pudding ( soooo delicious !)I'll be back for a round of brunch some time"
Jon W.,"New York, NY",5/22/2011,5 star rating,"There was a moment during my meal at ABC Kitchen when I looked at the plates in front of me and exhaled with complete satisfaction. I also felt the need to unbuckle my belt and crawl into the fetal position and fall asleep in the corner. I can't remember the last time I experienced a meal that was so comforting and yet completely unfamiliar. Each dish that came to the table was near perfection. The ambiance was quaint with a hint of chic. The clientele, everything you'd expect from a trendy hole in the wall spot in the flatiron district. Beautiful people littered the space like a fashion show and yet all I could really focus on or care about was the food.Organic is the way of life here and you can taste the freshness in the dishes prepared. Each dish had full frontal flavors and layers of texture that made each bite a journey into something unexplored.Once the meal started, there was no going back... each dish came at us like a fleet of Japanese Kamikazee planes at Pearl Harbor.. diving deliciously into our bellies. We completely devoured the raw scallops with lime zest as if it was an oasis in the desert. The pretzel crusted calamari had a mild spice to them and were extremely delicate. The cured meats & cheese plate was layered with flavors and texture; great selection of cheeses and some of the freshest cuts of meat I've had in a long time. The ramp and goat cheese toast was a flavor I've never experienced before and I was amazed how the goat cheese didn't overpower the ramps. Next up were our entrees! To say we were stuffed is an understatement, we could barely lift our forks to the plate. I ordered the fried chicken with ginger. The chicken was PERFECT! Crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, and more importantly it was plentiful! I could barely get through three bites when someone mentioned dessert. Dessert came and I felt the buttons on my shirt begin to give way. If you're going to go for dessert, there's only one dish you need to have. The sundae! DONE! A great combination of sweet and savory, with salted caramel ice cream, popcorn & chocolate sauce. It was everything a dessert should be and more.All in all, ABC Kitchen was beyond superb. Get there NOW!"
Joanna C.,"North Potomac, MD",12/9/2012,4 star rating,"Came here for dinner Tuesday night with 3 friends and it was packed, for good reason too! The restaurant was beautiful, with these rustic-chic feel and all of the wait staff was dressed in flannel (I am so envious and wish I could wear flannel to work). We had a reservation for 8 and got to the restaurant around 7:50, but had to wait until about 8:20 before being seated. By then, we were all hungry and ready for food. Luckily for us, they quickly brought up the Roasted Kabocha Squash Toast, Fresh Ricotta and Apple Cider Vinegar, compliments of the kitchen. It was delicious and definitely my favorite dish of the night (not including dessert, which was also amazing and so hard to compare)! It was savory, but with some tanginess to it and just so incredible.With that to tide us over, we started to peruse the menu. The menu was artsy and also listed all of the farms where they get their food from on the back. Our waitress disappeared for a while, which was fine since we were indecisive about what we wanted to eat, but then she finally came back and took our orders.We started with drinks and shared several appetizers. I got the Vermont Gold Vodka Thyme Lemonade, which was dangerously delicious. It tasted like sweet lemonade with just a little bit of vodka, but was one of the strongest drinks I had ever had (yes, I have low tolerance, but feeling inebriated after half of a drink is pretty ridiculous, even by my standards). We then shared the Cured Meats and Cheeses; Crispy Delicata Squash, Maple Syrup and Grated Goat Cheese; and Roasted Beets with Housemade Yogurt. The beets with yogurt were pretty good. I never would've thought to put the two together but somehow it worked. It's a pretty simple dish, but really brings out the fresh flavor of the beets. ABC Kitchen really knows what it's doing with its squash. I'm personally not a big fan of fried food so I didn't love the crispy squash, but it was it still well-cooked and had a great squash flavor. The meats and cheeses were fine, but given how good the other appetizers are and how you can probably find better at cheese restaurants, I'd pass on this one and opt for more squash.Then came the entrees. I had the Seabass with Chilies and Herbs, Baby Market Potatoes and Spinach. Unfortunately, the seabass failed to impress. It had a nice texture and the spinach was good, but there was all around too much oil and lemon flavoring. My friend's Kasha and Bowtie Pasta with Veal Meatballs however, was delicious. All in all, we agreed that the market table appetizers outshined the entrees.After stuffing our stomachs with food and drink, our waitress asks us that ever so tempting question, ""Do you want to see the dessert menu?"" I shook my head no, but two of my dessert-loving friends eagerly cried out yes. Realizing how full we all were, we opted to share the Sundae. Good thing we didn't order more since we were also served chocolate Cake Pops, compliments of the kitchen again. The cake pops were a rich chocolate flavor and tasted great with the Sundae, which was amazing. Sea salt caramel ice cream with pop corn and drizzles of chocolate sauce, yum (there is whipped cream on it too, but I avoided that part). I was so full and my stomach was crying out to me to stop, but this dessert was so amazing and irresistible that I found myself eating a few spoonfuls of it until I decided that my dress had gotten too tight and I would literally explode if I had a bite more.ABC Kitchen lived up to its hype and as long as you're willing to endure some long waits in there, definitely check it out sometime. And if you do, I'd suggest just getting tons of market table/appetizers and dessert, and a drink or two of course."
Sally Z.,"San Francisco, CA",12/15/2016,4 star rating,"My friend was able to get a reservation here for brunch just a few days ahead of time. I was so surprised because it was always impossible for me to find an open table at a decent hour!We came for brunch. First off, the decor. Wow. It could have been in any home magazine. Rustic yet cozy and elegant. We had a mini photo shoot before we could even look at the menu. When we finally decided, we ordered the roasted carrot salad, I had the crab toast and then we shared a salted caramel popcorn with ice cream. The roasted carrot salad was actually my favorite dish even though I really don't like carrots. I usually never order anything with carrots especially if it's the main component of the dish. But this was so good with avocado and the charred flavor on the carrots and the sauce and the crunch from the pine nuts I think. Just very well balanced in texture and taste and perfect as an appetizer. The crab toast had been written about a lot but I didn't find it spectacular. The toast was too toasted and hurt to bite into. The crab was very fresh however and had the sweet taste of fresh seafood. It was perfect with some lemon squeezed on top. The dessert was way too sweet for me. The salty and sweet were both so strong they were fighting each other. However, I did like the popcorn which added a good crunch factor. I would come back again to try some of their other dishes, but  probably for a nicer occasion and the food was quite pricey."
Janel Y.,"Walnut Creek, CA",6/29/2012,3 star rating,"Here's what we ordered:-rhubarb mimosa ($14): okay-BTL mother's milk ($7): dark lager which is oh so smooth-kale salad with lemon ($14): very tart-ramp toast ($13): would definitely get two orders of this!-suckling pig ($34): delicious! moist and tender, had an Asian spin on it-ABCK burger ($24): had a bite and thought it was pretty darn good. meat was cooked perfectly, plenty of grated cheese-sundae ($13): loved the popcorn on top!From the outside, it doesn't look like much, but once you're inside, it's spacious with a tall ceiling and plenty of tables and room. I loved the fresh produce table and the dishes were so cute. Service was standard and the food was great. I had heard so much about this place that I was expecting to be blown away. Yes, the food quality and taste was great, but it didn't floor me.Note: I found the chairs to be uncomfortable"
Vanessa D.,"North Issaquah, Issaquah, WA",9/3/2018,5 star rating,Great experience! Went here for my birthday and really enjoyed it. Food was amazing and service as well! The only thing I would change was the value-overall a little pricey but definitely worth it.
Joannitte R.,"Manhattan, NY",11/11/2013,5 star rating,"I have been wanting to try ABC for months now and finally I was able to get a table for dinner.. At 5:30pm on a Monday! Since beggars can't be choosers off we went! I can go on and on with the details but ultimately, jean georges did not disappoint! Everything was yummy and there wasn't anything I didn't like. My favorite item was the house made ricotta with the fig compote and grilled bread! WOW! Might be the best thing I've ever put in my mouth! Definitely go.Definitely have the ricotta.Thank me later."
Dennis C.,"New York, NY",3/30/2011,5 star rating,"Oh, ABC...it's been 2 meals and you just get better.  Once my lease is up, I'm moving in!!!Made a reservation for Brunch for my wife's birthday (it's really tough getting dinner reservations unless you want to eat at 1030pm).  We arrived and were seated right away.  None of that, ""It'll be a few minutes so why don't you have some drinks at the bar and we'll call you."".We sat in a cozy spot and eagerly snatched the menu from our waiter. (Sorry, waiter)  It's a bit loud in there but don't let that deter you.  You and your companion will be enjoying the food too much to waste time on conversation.Decor: Loved it!  It's like eating in a barn that was partially converted into a gallery that serves great food minus the smell of fertilizer.Appetizers: Chicken Liver Toast- Delicious and savory.  My only gripe is that the toast was too toasted and too thick.  I think a thinner piece of bread that is mildly toasted would have worked better.Crab Toast with Lemon Aioli- I wish this was available as a foot-long sub.  Fresh crabmeat with freshly squeezed lemon juice and just the right amount of aioli makes this appetizer sing!  Entree: Turkey Sandwich with Applewood Bacon and Fries- Fresh crusty bread with a nice slathering of olive oil inside.  It had just the right amount of turkey but the bacon wasn't as crunchy as I would have liked.  The biggest surprise was the french fries: they had fried garlic chips in there, too!  BONUS!Dessert: Pear Bread Pudding- Haagen Daaz needs to make this a flavor, STAT!.  The combination of textures and temperature were perfect.  Warm soft pear bread pudding topped with pear ice cream and thin delicate pear chips in a puddle of caramel sauce.Service: Great service, all smiles, and cool flannel shirts that I'd want to buy (Seriously, ABC, can I buy one?).I think I'll be going back for MY birthday."

Sarina H.,"New York, NY",8/21/2010,3 star rating,"We went to ABC last Friday.  First off, the sign needs to be a little more conspicuous.  We arrived on time for our 6pm reservation but took a few seconds to look for it.We entered through the bar area...pretty empty for a Friday night (though I guess 6pm is early for NY standards).  Our less than friendly hostess led us to our table in the main dining room.  One thing's for certain, the decor is beautiful.  White, glass, clean lines.  By the open kitchen was a bountiful display of fresh fruits and vegetables.  Another staple I saw...were the myriad of pregnant women.  I swear, every other table had one.Anyhoo...we were greeted with the complimentary radishes which were.......hm, potent?  It was spicy, and a little too powerful for me.  I wasn't really sure why that was offered as a welcome treat.  We ordered drinks.  They were just ok I thought, nothing special.Service was good in the beginning.  Our waitress took the time to give us her feedback on her favorites from the menu.  We ended up ordering the peekytoe crab toast to start (fantastic), the hamachi sashimi marinated in ginger (good), and the heirloom tomato salad - it was good, but nothing spectacular.For entrees, I had the tomato and housemade chicken sausage, ricotta and kale pizza.  Hubby had the pork, heirloom tomato, nepittella dish.  We also ordered a side of fries.  My pizza was good, but a little greasy...not outstanding.  I managed to have 2 slices and took the rest home.  Hubby liked his pork - no complaints.  Desserts consisted of the sundae (excellent) and the carrot cake.  The cake could have used a little work.  Presentation was plain.   Cake was borderline dry.  An addition of whipped cream or something could have salvaged it.  We were not offered coffee or tea..which I found to be strange.It was around this time that we noticed that Jeffrey Steingarten (""The Man Who Ate Everything""; veteran judge of ""Iron Chef"") walked in and sat in the 4 top behind us.  The hostess came over us sort of abrasively told us to stop taking pictures with our flash, which I guess is a courtesy gesture to Mr. Steingarten...but her approach could have been more friendly.  I felt rushed; service really dwindled towards the end of the meal. Our waitress was never seen from again until she was standing over hubby as he signed off on our bill.   I don't think I'll return."
Kyle M.,"Manhattan, NY",7/8/2012,5 star rating,"Get a reservation because you will have to wait.  I waited about 45 minutes on a weekend at about 10 pm which isn't too bad considering how great the food is.  Waiting isn't bad anyway there is plenty of space in the front bar area to have a drink while you wait and they automatically transfer your bar tab to your dinner tab which is awesome.  Mixed drinks were expensive but VERY good, they have some nice local beers on tap as well.  Service was great and the decor is very nice.  Get the tomato toast it is AMAZING.  Calamari was also excellent.  Not a huge fan of the sea bass but everything else was excellent.  A bit on the pricey side but you get what you pay for and it was well worth it.  Great for dates 1st though infinity and groups if you can get a reservation."
Patricia D.,"Norwalk, CT",4/23/2015,5 star rating,"My husband and I took our son, who is a chef, to eat here at the end of February, 2015. The only thing better than the food was the service! My husband was able to set up a kitchen visit with the sous-chef for our son, who was delighted by the experience. We had an 11pm reservation and despite the late hour, our server never made us feel rushed or unwelcome. We stayed for dessert and coffee and didn't leave the restaurant until 1h45am! Imagine my surprise to discover we were the only people left in the place.All around an excellent experience and we will definitely be returning there soon."
Amanda L.,"Denver, CO",11/6/2015,5 star rating,"If I were one of those ""ladies who lunch"", I'd lunch at ABC Kitchen on a regular basis. The lunch prix fixe is such a deal, considering the quality of food you get.The ambience during lunchtime is lively enough that it's interesting, but not so lively that it's distracting. That plus the great food makes it a perfect ""special lunch"" place for me. There's a homey kind of feel to the place, so you're getting yummy food at a reasonable price point without a stuffy atmosphere.Would return! Perhaps for dinner next time :)"
Veronika K.,"New York, NY",8/12/2015,5 star rating,"Fantastic restaurant, impeccable service.The mushroom pizza was to die for and the bread is so fresh, it basically melts. It's amazing.I loved it and will definitely be coming back!"
Lauren M.,"London, United Kingdom",6/23/2016,5 star rating,"One of my favourite places to eat in the city, both for brunch and dinner. It's hard to get a reservation but I have managed to be seated for brunch for 2 people just walking in within 30 minutes on a couple of occasions. They have one of the best eggs Benedict around in my opinion. Also love their french toast (ideally me and a friend would order both then split them so I can get a taste of each!). Dinner is great too, although not the biggest portions, it does mean I can eat all 3 courses without being overly full!Love the light decor in here - always persuades me to go for a browse around their store afterwards!"
Katherine C.,"Black Mountain, NC",1/11/2018,3 star rating,Fabulous food! Lovely decor! Sloooooooooow service. Like no one at the bar but drinks taking 15-20 minutes. The waiter wasn't rude but certainly didn't seem to be interested in us. I hope I'm wrong but some restaurants in NYC who have the press and scene vibes seem to be declining on service.
Brooke B.,"NY, NY",1/12/2016,5 star rating,"Phenomenal dinner experience. Not just because it was my birthday, but truly unique cocktails and farm fresh food that made me feel as if I was in a fairy garden. Service was exceptional (almost cleaned up too much actually). Can't wait to bring others here. Highly recommend the cranberry, ricotta starter with grilled toast, followed by the avocado and carrot salad (spicy and exquisite!), followed by the Hake entree. To finish, because I was the birthday girl, a piece of chocolate cake with toasted marshmallow icing. Heavenly meal and experience xoxo"
Elizabeth L.,"New York, NY",4/24/2011,5 star rating,"Wow, the crab toast was one of the best things I've eaten in...a long time. So amazingly fresh and delicious. I might go back to ABC Kitchen next week just to order it again.As with Jean-Georges other restaurants, this place has an amazing lunch pre-fixe. For $25, you get three entrees, and the portions are extremely generous. For instance, I ordered the kabocha toast for my appetizer thinking it would be half the size of the actual appetizer. It was the same size, and I was full after just eating that! My atlantic char was very tender and not dry at all. Loved the sauce, and tasted some of the pot roast (which was another choice on the pre-fixe menu). It was also very good if a bit heavier than my dish. I should have ordered the orange creamsicle tart for dessert. It tasted a little like a Chinese dan tat (egg tart), and was delicious! I got the caramel popcorn sundae, which was also delicious, but a tad too sweet for me. Must be getting old...Loved the atmosphere. Very clean, shabby-chic place. Service was a little slow, but the bread was super fresh and the furniture store's connected so you could technically do some shopping while you wait for your food. Would go again and again if reservations weren't so hard to come by..."
Joyce H.,"New York, NY",6/3/2012,4 star rating,"3.5 stars for the food, + 1 star for the ambiance and decor.This is a beautiful romantic restaurant with the cutest plates and bowls you will ever see. I loved the chandeliers, the shabby chic decor, the flowers twisted on lamps hanging off the ceilings...the ambiance was great, enough to start my review on.Now for the food. To be honest, my omelette was not good. I don't like omelettes where the ingredients are wrapped in the egg separately from the eggs, not cooked with the eggs themselves. In this case, the eggs were thick and seemed very separate from the fillings of ramps, asparagus, and goat cheese.My starters were delicious though. We split the crab toast with lemon aioli, the roasted carrot avocado salad, the doughnuts, and the bacon biscuits. Everything was delicious. I definitely recommend the crab toast and the roasted carrot salad. My friends also enjoyed the salted caramel ice cream with pop corn, so if you're into caramel, I think you'd like this dessert.I think I'd come back but order off of the lunch menu next time. Such a cute place."
DK H.,"Rolling Hills Estates, CA",9/4/2013,4 star rating,"Recommended by my boss... Was excited to experience ABC Kitchen. First, I screwed up my reservation time and they were accommodating- thank you!!!  Love the atmosphere- very cool. Service was great- food was good- we sampled many.  Cheese plate to start- always good. Strawberry cocktail was delicious. Yum! Burger (me) and fish (friend) were good (not fabulous) but the sides of spicy corn & mashed potatoes were delicious. So delicious. Dessert of almond cake and market strawberries was great as well.Overall, love the service, good (some better than others) and the decor.  Great place- I would definitely go back."
Michael C.,"Chicago, IL",6/15/2015,4 star rating,"A solid repeat....maybe getting too expensive?Started with Crab Toast (so simple, so great), roasted beets (on top of yogurt...OMG), roast carrot and avocado salad (how can carrots be this good?).  Finished with sauteed salmon (a potent carrot puree, unfortunately fish was tad overdone) and the fried chicken (fried organic chicken, wild spinach, basil and hot sauce butter...fantastic).  Everything was really, really good in a beautiful place with very attentive care.  I guess I'm just balking at entrees north of $30.  I'd still go back."
Anita m.,"Pasadena, CA",11/17/2014,5 star rating,"So good! I won points with my foodie hubs for booking this spot for our first dinner in NY. Even at 6:30 the place was bustling and got busier as the night went on. The interior is so cute - white brick walls, shabby chic and the staff all dress in plaid shirts. Julian, our waiter, was very knowledgeable of the menu and very polite. Vibe is casual. Bread with olive oil is brought after you order with a small bowl of sea salt to sprinkle on top. We started with the crab toast with lemon aioli - toast was so crispy and crab was fresh. If you're not a mayo person, ask for no mayo (or on the side) bc there are drops of mayo on top. Love that the toast was already cut otherwise I would have cut them in my favor and would have taken the bigger half. Fried chicken w/spinach and mashed potatoes (added on as extra, on the side). Hubs wanted comfort food and absolutely loved how crispy this came out. Crispy pork confit with bacon marmalade. Hello! you had me at bacon. I couldn't get enough of the crispy pork belly or marmalade! The potato puree underneath was so smooth and rounded out the saltiness of the bacon and pork belly.Cocktails - I got the 'big apple' and hubs got the basil lime daiquiri. The big apple was lightly sweet and a little strong. The basil lime was very herb-y and was very good. I would love to come back to this spot again. The price point of this place is on par  with other 5 star restaurants. Two people can reasonably eat under the price of a pair of designer jeans."
Derek Y.,"Toronto, Canada",8/13/2018,5 star rating,"wonderful lunch at ABC kitchen. This is our first visit with 2 children and a baby. The staff were very accommodating. We checked in our stroller. The service was fantastic, friendly and timely. The bread was delicious. We had the kale salad, cheeseburger, pizza, and seared salmon. The food was delicious. It was a very lively ambience, making for an elegant but not pretentious meal. We really had a wonderful meal. Moderately expensive but worth the experience. Will be back! Reservations recommended."
Richard S.,"Delray Beach, FL",9/24/2015,4 star rating,"I have read about ABC kitchen and we were in New York and decided to try it for lunch.Unusual menu and a little on the pricey side but worth it.I had the 3 course prix fixe lunch for $33 which included starter, entrée and dessert. I had the line caught tuna sashimi marinated with ginger and mint, excellent especially the marinade. For an entrée, I had the grilled portobello sandwich, arugula and parmesan, lemon mayo, jalapenos, small and just fair. For dessert, salted caramel ice cream sundae with candied peanuts & popcorn, whipped cream, chocolate sauce, outstandingMy wife and son shared the roasted beets with homemade yogurt, which they thoroughly enjoyed and shared the akaushi cheeseburger with herbed mayo and pickled jalapenos, also very good.I can't wait to return and try some of the other items on the menu which intrigued me.."

Ali H.,"Brooklyn, NY",4/11/2018,5 star rating,"First time going to this restaurant and was not disappointed. Something to note is portions are quite small. We started with the ramp and goat cheese toast which was amazing. So happy I got to experience this toast while ramps are in season (something crazy like 3 weeks I think?!) Next we had the kale and Serrano salad with lime. Dayum that Serrano is spicy! Luckily I was avidly to pick them out and give to my husband lol! The salad was great with the tiniest cutest croutons you have ever seen. Next we had the tuna sashimi which was melt in your mouth fresh. I rarely eat raw fish but I saw this dish and knew it was high quality tuna and worth trying. So happy I did! The marinade/sauce it came in was tangy and citrusy. Seriously delicious. The waiter suggested dipping the crusty bread they give for the table into the marinade and OMGGGGG. Next we had the fettuccini with fresh peas and pesto. Seriously refined and delicious. The perfect amount of pasta. Now, as you can imagine by this point I was stuffed. But we had ordered the mushroom pizza and that was up next.  To me, this was the weakest dish of the night compared to the awesomeness of the rest. My husband, on the other hand loved it and gobbled it up with no problem. For dessert (treat yo self) we shared the chocolate Creme brûlée. I do prefer the classic vanilla bean but this was nice. All in all, excellent service and excellent food."
David D.,"Greenwood, NY",8/8/2018,5 star rating,"This place is really exceptional. The service is really wonderful. Our server Emily was fantastic and accommodating and made my girlfriend's birthday dinner a truly awesome experience. The support staff was equally up to par though I did not get everyone's name. On previous visits I've had the pleasure of sitting with Tom White, a fantastic bartender, and enjoyed immensely. Emily our server was able to make sure our first visit to the dining room was a perfect one. My only minor complaint would be that the tempura string beans left something to be desired, but certainly not enough of a knock to have any kind of problem. Thanks again to the crew here, we greatly appreciate your service."
Dee N.,"San Jose, CA",11/17/2017,5 star rating,So good when I had dinner! All the apps were good. Main courses were also delicious. It's so  coastal and pretty inside. I'd definitely come back.
Chris C.,"Parsippany, NJ",11/2/2011,5 star rating,"I mastered the Basil Daquiri at home. So now my fiance is a little sad as it doesn't have the mystique as it did when it was only available to her at ABC Kitchen. It's one shot each of  simple sugar, light rum and lime juice then you muddle fresh basil in it and shake over a martini glass. Voila! Don't worry about infusing the simple syrup its not really needed and you don't get the fresh burst of basil flavor without muddling the basil. This time around we had a manhattan more of the basil daquiri concoction. heirloom tomatoes. Fresh tomato cheese pizza and the clam pizza. I think the menu just shifted a little as it wasn't on the menu last time. Love it all. Saved room for the Sundae.  It was very good but not my thing. It had the salty sweet, fudgey, crunchy, gooey thing going on but all in all not my fave. The donuts that were on another guests table looked awesome though! Like a fried zeppole from the San Gennaro festival. Can't wait to go again and order another mushroom pizza or try one of the other entrees.... on second thought nah...maybe the mushroom pizza. That thing is just addicting!"
O B.,"Bayside, NY",6/14/2015,4 star rating,"Great veggie burger--flavorful, crunchy exterior and smooth filling without feeling grainy or cardboard-y). Inside a homemade whole wheat pita with a yummy carrot slaw on the side, but seemed a bit pricey at $20. Lovely and spacious decor with a friendly staff."
Steph G.,"Kips Bay, Manhattan, NY",7/18/2017,5 star rating,"I made a reservation for 4 at 8:00 here about 1.5 weeks ago, but honestly it was not that busy so I think you'd be fine walking in without one. However, this quickly became my favorite restaurant in NYC so I don't recommend risking it. The way the restaurant is decorated and laid out is perfection down to ever last detail. I won't get into it because its something worth seeing for yourself... We started with some wine and the pretzel crusted calamari-- incredible. They bring out bread too, which was awesome. I split the spinach and goat cheese za and the half size of the jalapeño and ricotta angel hair pasta. The other girls I was with split the other 2 pastas. The raviolis were DIVINE. For dessert we got the sundae that came with the cracker jacks. we weren't too hungry, but we couldn't skip the most important part of the meal. Definitely don't forget to order dessert even if you're not too hungry! I can't wait to come back-- maybe for brunch??"
Danielle K.,"Garden City, NY",10/11/2017,3 star rating,My husband recommended the place- he had been before. We started with the crab toast and liver pate- both good..lots of garlic in one of them..think it might of been the crab. For our main course I had the special Black Sea bass with potatoes and spinach. I found this dish flat- with no seasoning except for a drop of chili oil on the fish. The fish was prepared very nicely with a nice crisp sear on it but the potatoes and spinach seemed just boiled and lacked even salt. The wait staff was great and attentive- no issues. Space a little loud if you are trying to have a conversation..a little tough.
Simone N.,"Toronto, Canada",6/3/2016,4 star rating,"I would rate 4.5/5. Coming in, the place looks truly unique; very chic yet charming and organic.The service was good, nothing to complain about.We had 4 dishes:1. Crab toastThis was my first time eating crab. Fresh and flavourful. We both enjoyed it.2. CalamariOur least liked menu item and our first time eating calamari as well. It was bland even though there's a pretzel crust. The marinara dipping sauce was the best part of that dish.3. PancakesServed with lemon curd...nice flavour and not too heavy. 4. French ToastBf had the french toast and he said it was the best he had ever had. He described it as really light yet substantial and great flavour.Overall really good food and I would go again if I went back to NYC - even though its on the pricier side."
Bartek W.,"Manhattan, NY",8/3/2016,1 star rating,"The food was decent (shaved raw fluke was really good, ravioli was good and chocolate cake was terrible). On the other hand, I waited almost 30 minutes for RESERVED table. Did not hear ""sorry"" from the staff or any information that there may be a delay. Don't go there if your time is limited.This was the ONLY restaurant I visited during NYC Restaurant Week where I experienced such a delay."
Bjorn P.,"New York, NY",5/24/2015,4 star rating,I have wanted to go to ABC Kitchen for awhile. Jean George's casual spot so to speak attached to ABC Home. The place has gotten rave reviews both in Yelp and otherwise. I dropped in one Friday night and was told the wait was an hour but low and behold got seats at the bar in the back. Yes! The restaurant is absolutely beautiful - from he lighting to the big wood tables to be old worn steel - it's phenomenal. One of the more beautiful spaces I've been to. The service was also stellar - the waiters were dressed in plaid shirts of what seemed like their own choosing and then jeans. They were all highly knowledgeable and friendly - it was like you were with friends and they were a part of the environment rather than a separate entity. So how was the food...well...its a mixed bag. We got the following:- Crab Toast: Excellent with a heap of fresh peaky toe crab and crunchy toasted thick bread with a dollop of lemon aioli - yum- Black Sea Bass - so the flavor was good but I didn't like the skin. I mean the dish was tasty and the soup is nice to pour over the fish and spinach for more flavor but I just wasn't that impressed - Mozzarella /basil whole wheat pizza - also just ok. The sauce was very good and the pizza was well made but there is definitely better pizza in the city- Vodka Thyme Lemonade - great drink - highly recommended So our waiter actually had told us how good the burger was and the three Texans that had told him it was the best burger they had had...but we ignored him to our detriment. Additionally the oven roasted lobster looked amazing and the mushroom and egg pizza - but - we just didn't order them. I will definitely be back to order them and I'm sure this rating will go up but for now...this is what I got.
Brian K.,"Manhattan, NY",8/13/2019,5 star rating,"Service impeccable, food scrumptious, it felt like exquisite dining and just was a nice lunch with a good friend.  Food choices were varied enough, bread just right, service was responsive without being intrusive.  Just my kind of meal: no frills, elegant, delicious.  Thank you, ABC.  You got it exactly right this time."
Callie S.,"Boston, MA",2/8/2016,4 star rating,"Great decor and great food! Amazing kale salad and raviolo. The salad is very refreshing and yummy. The raviolo is filled with cheese and on top of beef ragu. Soooooo delicious! For desserts, I gotta give 2 thumbs up for salted caramel ice cream which is served with caramel popcorn. Omg it's the best ice cream I've ever tasted! :D the service was also very very nice. Looking forward to coming back next time!"
Natalie R.,"Boca Raton, FL",6/1/2016,5 star rating,"From the atmosphere to the food and the service everything was perfect. The decor was incredibly beautiful. The staff was attentive and friendly and to top it all off the food was truly excellent. Crab toast is a must as well as the shaved raw fluke, for your main you could honestly order anything and it would be excellent, for dessert hands down go with the seasonal doughnuts they are incredible!"
Jason E.,"New York, NY",12/20/2017,5 star rating,"I love the food here. We've had pretty much everything on the menu and it seems impossible for them to mess anything up. Try the cocktails. I am not a cocktail person, but they have a watermelon mezcal drink that is delicious. Yes, ABC Kitchen is pricey, but quality matters. If you have a special occasion coming up, this is your place."
Alice C.,"Alexandria, VA",7/1/2015,3 star rating,"Ambience is chic. We ordered apps and dessert only. Crab toast was mediocre, not sure why it was a yelp highlight. The crab on top wasn't anything special. The toast was hard, the edges crouton like. Tuna sashimi didn't have a distinguished flavor. BUT the roasted carrot and avocado salad was delicious. The carrot tasted delicious, they did not skimp on avocado at all. The salad paired great w the carrot and avocado. This was 5 stars Sundae must be shared. It wAs good, but too sweet and I love sweet. 2-3 people can share this The raspberry tart was good, on the small side. One person can eat this.Because I haven't tried the entrees, this is a high 3 for now."
Elvir C.,"New York, NY",10/2/2010,4 star rating,"Bright. Airy. Unfinished decor. Recyclable elements. Rustic. Farm-to-table. Buzzwords? Yes. However, push aside the buzz, and let the food speak for them.It speaks LOUDLY. ABC Kitchen prides itself on using simple, fresh and local ingredients, we like that.Came here for brunch w/ great friends who love good food, and definitely picked the right place. Here's the rundown.Pretzel Dusted Calamari - Nicely fried, not greasy. The Calamari wasn't chewy or gummy at all--very tender and almost melted in your mouth. I guess it's a sign of freshness. Pretzel-y crust was perfect, light and crisp. The mustard aioli beats the marinara.Peeky Toe Crab Toast - Didn't have this b/c of my shellfish allergy. My friends said it was amazing.Grilled Portabello Sandwich w/ arugula & lemon mayo - Surprisingly ordered by my friend who's a meat-eater from Texas. The fresh ingredients and flavor were intense and well balanced.Akaushi Cheeseburger - Didn't have this either, but friends say good, not spectacular. Roasted Carrot And Avocado Salad - Suprisingly good. The carrots were perfectly roasted--smoky, sweet and slightly meaty.Goat Cheese Spinach Herb Pizza - Amazing. The saltiness of the goat cheese isn't overwhelming, but well balanced w/ the fresh spinach, parsley and dill--which brings a brightness and extra layer of savory. Toasted Corn w/ lime and cotija cheese - Simple, but you can taste the freshness in the sweet corn. Sweet, tangy and salty. Yum.Toasted Marshmallow Chocolate Ganache Cake - This was good, but not exceptional. My favorite part was the ganache between the layers. The cake was airy and rich at the same time. The Marshmallow frosting was indeed marshmallow-y. Fresh Glazed Doughnuts - Tasty, but would've preferred them warm. The strawberry rhubarb preserves are a perfect compliment.So all in all, a 4.5. Would've been a 5, but the dessert options didn't seem to live up to the rest of the meal. Aside from dessert, the meal was spectacularly delicious. Will I come back here? DEFINITELY. Jean-Georges has a magical way w/ his food and restaurants and ABC is no exception. Fresh local ingredients, simple preparation, and amazing execution. These are all signs of a winner."
Ruth U.,"New York, NY",6/28/2015,2 star rating,"Over hyped, over priced, hard to get reservation but I did, and it was meh.. Service is shoddy, food was ok, lacks vegan and vegetarian options. Cocina is a million times better."
Kat M.,"Tucson, AZ",7/15/2017,3 star rating,"it's okay. i think the hype around it leads to expectations that are not realizable. The food was good, the setting/decor is just adorable, but something felt forced, or commercial. Wanted to love it. just meh."
LeAnne B.,"New York, NY",4/16/2017,5 star rating,"Had the pork and was super happy with my choice :) so tender and the mashed potatoes + turnips that came with it were amazing.  Great atmosphere too and when we were trying to find the place we actually walked past it cause the outside was so subtle. Almost has a speakeasy vibe, great place"
H. Arvy M.,"Arlington, VA",6/5/2015,5 star rating,"The problem with this place is that we never go anywhere else.  My wife and I ate here this evening for her birthday and the food and service were fantastic.  We started with the mushroom toast--a bruschetta-like dish--which was a sautéed shiitake mushroom topping, wonderfully seasoned with hints of lemon and parsley atop perfectly toasted rustic sourdough.  The market fare marinated olives were plump and tasty and the serving size was generous, making it well worth the $8.Our main course was the fried chicken, which was perfectly seasoned, crisp, juicy, and hot and is not to be missed.For dessert, although we were satiated, we had the chocolate cake and carrot cake, which were both excellent.  The carrot cake frosting was perfectly rich and at the same time, light.  And the salted caramel ice cream sundae with chocolate sauce, candied peanuts and popcorn, was over-the-top delicious.  ABC Kitchen is one of our favorite restaurants anywhere.  It's modern and chic, yet warm and welcoming.  And the food is excellent as well."
Cam E.,"New York, NY",9/28/2010,5 star rating,"As a fan of Jean Georges UWS, ABC Kitchen did not disappoint.The green concept and fair prices all blend well with the soothing organic atmosphere. Loved, loved, Apps - **crab toast, ***tuna sashima with ginger and mintMains:  ***Halibut, ***Artic CharDessert:  we shared sundae salted caramel peanut ice cream with fudge sauce.Will definitely return."
Valerie C.,"New York, NY",4/9/2012,4 star rating,"I made ressies long in advance for a dinner at Jean Georges' acclaimed new resto - ABC Kitchen! The moment I stepped in I fell in love with the ambiance and atmosphere. The decor was definitely organic and at one with nature. I almost felt like it was a very upscale farm ;)We started off with the carrot & avocado salad and peeky toe crab toast, per Yelp reccos and were not disappointed! You could truly discern the fresh ingredients in the salad and the peeky toe crab was just divine. There was a generous amount of crab atop the crostini as well.For entrees, we went with the mushroom, parmesan, oregano, and farm egg pizza ($18) and the organic crispy chicken ($26). I thought the pizza was just mediocre and the crust became quite soggy as the night went on. My dining companion enjoyed his chicken - I had a bite and it was nice and succulent with perfect fried skin. We finished off our meal with the salted caramel sundae ($12), which was very good and justified for the price tag. I must say though, my favorite part of ABC Kitchen are their cute bathrooms! Love the speckled gray design on their mirrors; I had quite a good time taking photos in there ;)"
Juan J.,"Brooklyn, NY",8/17/2012,3 star rating,"The ambiance is amazing for a girls brunch or lunch.  Who does not love little antique plates and cups, and fancy silverware?We ordered the crab toast, and it was loaded with fresh crab meat.  I had the crispy skate salad, however the skate was only ordinary and the salad was bland (although I am sure they used organic local produced veggies).  I got the sundae for desert, however the ice cream was also ordinary and the candied popcorn within just was not my cup of tea, although my coworker thought otherwise.I would go back for a girls brunch, because this place is very pretty and had very good looking people in it (I would like to imagine I was one of them)."
Lina W.,"New York, NY",4/27/2017,3 star rating,"Pretty restaurant with decent food.  Pizza with mushrooms were yummy and kale salad was ok.  I thought the entrees were ok, but I wasn't wow'd.  Pasta was good but $17 for the half portion was on the pricier side ($24 for full portion).  3 of us ordered pasta and thought the same...I've had better pasta at home!  Overall, ambiance was nice, service was great, food and dessert was ""eh"" not bad, but not impressive.  You're basically paying $$$ for the ambiance and friendly service, food you can get for better and cheaper at a neighborhood restaurant.   And this place felt more touristy than NYC hip."
Latrice J.,"Brooklyn, NY",9/23/2017,5 star rating,This place is a A+ from the food to the service! I drank the pina colada which was amazing. The guacamole what's everything super fresh super tasty. The bar was quick and personable
Mia R.,"Redwood City, CA",9/24/2015,3 star rating,"Had dinner at the bar. Friendly servers and nice dark pretty atmosphere. The food was good, not great. Had the crab toast at the recommendation of the bartender and it was very tasty with a generous helping of crab and plenty of zesty lemon flavors. Also ordered the fresh fettucine with pistachio pesto, which was alright. Nothing too flavorful or memorable. Maybe I just ordered the wrong entree. Had the chocolate cake for dessert - again just ok, nothing amazing or really incredible about it."
Bailey Z.,"Las Vegas, NV",3/31/2013,2 star rating,"The name, Jean-Georges, is synonymous with excellence in dining in NYC. With this expectation, I was excited to finally try ABC Kitchen, the 2011 James Beard Award winner for Best New Restaurant. I arrived early and stepped into a well-decorated dining room. I felt like I had walked into an Anthropologie. The menu prices were certainly on par. However, when it came to the food, I was beyond disappointed. In fact, the meal was downright bad.Our party started off with three appetizers to share. The chicken liver toast tasted off. The pâté didn't have the smooth, velvety texture and there was no sweet ingredient to balance the flavors out. The pretzel dusted calamari was pedestrian. I cannot justify paying $16 for such a boring bowl of squid. There was nothing pretzel-dusted about it. The accompanying marinera and aioli has been done and overdone. Lastly, the roast carrot and avocado salad was nice, but again, nothing special. Onto the main courses. I had the black sea bass with chilies and herbs, with baby market potatoes and spinach. Sea bass is extremely difficult to overcook, yet somehow, they managed to find a way. The fish itself was completely bland. The chilies were so spicy to the point of making the entire dish unenjoyable. The chef was also a bit heavy-handed with the herbs - I think it was tarragon combined with the potatoes. I also tried the roasted maine scallops. If I'm only getting three small scallops, they better be perfectly cooked. Nope. They were rubbery and again, overcooked. Scallops can be easily seared and cooked within 5 minutes, so I don't quite understand how this happened in an hour. The one good dish was the whole wheat cavatelli with spicy rabbit ragu, ham and pecorino. The rabbit was very flavorful and the pasta was well done. The dessert. Everyone talked about the sundae with salted caramel ice cream, candied peanuts & popcorn, with whipped cream, and chocolate sauce. I did enjoy the salted caramel ice cream and popcorn, but the chocolate sauce was overwhelmingly sweet. If there was one dish that could cause diabetes on that menu, that would be it. Overall, the menu was unimaginative and there were several execution errors. The plating didn't even look nice. How this restaurant won a James Beard Award is beyond me. Save your money and run to Gramercy Tavern, which is only a few blocks away."
Vanessa M.,"Toronto, Canada",7/16/2018,5 star rating,"This was one of the best highlights of my trip to NYC. I took my boyfriend here for his 27th birthday and this place definitely surpassed my expectations.The crab toast with lemon aioli was one of the best things I have ever tasted. We also had for an appetizer, the shaved raw fluke. At first we were a little skeptical when ordering, but we were definitely wrong. This too was also incredible. The tuna also had so much flavor, definitely a must when coming here.My boyfriend ordered the fried chicken with a hot sauce butter. This sauce was unbelievably tasty I was in shock with how good it was.I ordered the salmon that was cooked over the best mashed potatoes I have ever had in my entire life. The salmon was also cooked to perfection & melted in your mouth.Overall everything we ordered was FANTASTIC. Highly recommend ordering all 5, you wont be disappointed.Also we ordered a bottle of the red Contessa Ava Chianti which was hands down one of the best wines we have ever had. I'm not dramatizing any of this, this restaurants deserves 11/10. To add, the service was also outstanding which made our experience even better than it already was. Among the incredible food, and fantastic service the decor was so cute & chic, you almost don't want to leave!"
Basil A.,"Denver, CO",3/18/2014,3 star rating,"From a design point of view this place scores on every mark. It's place with the ABC furniture store compliments its feel.The food on the other hand might be a hit or miss.-The Roasted Kobucha Squash with Ricotta Bruschetta was out of this world.-The Pretzel Coated Calamari was good but nothing special and the pretzel added nothing to it.-Lentil Soup was well executed. It was wholesome and flavorfull.- Chanterell Mushroom Spaghetti was a failure. The Spaghetti was over cooked and there was a guacamole like sauce that was overly pungent with rosemary that just ruined the dish.-Black Sea Bass was OK. It was a bit undercooked and the surrounding puddle of water, spinach and potatoes didn't add much.-Salted Caramel Sundae was the dessert that really made up for any shortcomings. Loved the textural balance between the ice cream, crunch from the peanuts, soft popcorn and fudge."
John O.,"Los Angeles, CA",8/3/2015,5 star rating,A fantastic Sunday night meal.  The crab toast is seriously one of the best dishes of 2015 in my book.  Mindblowingly good.  Other standouts were the mushroom pizza and the red snapper.  One dish was a miss and that was the raw fluke which was overpowered by the pepper and olives.  Service was excellent and the room has some real buzz.  Fantastic.
Zach B.,"Manhattan, NY",11/23/2014,2 star rating,"The head hostess at ABC kitchen gives me nightmares. She is one of the main reasons I never want to come here, despite living right around the corner. She is rude and snobby, I can't understand how she keeps her job here. Her demeanor is unacceptable. This restaurant has become a major tourist trap so of course they are typically busy, however, the hostess feels it's necessary to ALWAYS be running a wait so she KEEPS TABLES EMPTY. The ""reservation"" excuse is not always true, beware, once we finally get to sit after a long wait and finish our meal, those empty tables never fill up. It's bizarre. Also - most of the food is decent but the pizza has gone downhill since they opened AND their brunch menu is HORRIBLE. The french toast is deep fried like a burned doughnut - do not order it, ever. I had to send it back. The scrambled eggs with oysters, (also doughy, greasy, and deep-fried but not specified on the menu), is SO BAD and at $23, left me shocked it was served to us. There's better places in the area - try somewhere else."
Peter J.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",8/17/2015,4 star rating,"This place promotes itself as organic. I would agree that the entire menu felt and tasted healthy.The ambiance was great. It was dark with the hanging lightbulb look, but it also had a more lighted area, where we sat. The menu paper is made from 100% post consumer material.  I really like that.The food came out as it was prepared. We had:Drinks: strawberry soda and lemon thyme soda.  My girlfriend had the strawberry soda. she liked it. The lemon thyme soda had the sugar on the rim. In hindsight, I should have drank the soda, then filled it with water and drank off the rim. Either way, it was really fantastic.Appetizer: Crab toast with lemon aioli: this was really delicious, every bite. the sauce was good. Not too strong, not too light where the crab takes over. The bread it was on was a good texture. not too hard and crunchy, but wouldn't fall apart on you. Entree: kasha and bowtie pasta, veal meatballs- the dish had a unique taste to it. If you know Korean food, it hinted of jjajjangmyun. The flavor was good, but there was something missing in the pulling together of the whole dish. I like strong flavors, but this wasn't as strong.Appetizer: house made Chicken and pork sausage with pistachio potatoes and whole grain mustard. The sausage was good. Not too greasy like you would think when hearing sausage. It lacked that certain punch I was looking for, but definitely above par. Couldn't really make out the mustard when eating.  Wish they threw in a bit more jalapeno? peppers, they were not spicy, but flavorful for sure.Dessert: seasonal donuts with cafe latte.  there were three donuts: blueberry, strawberry jelly donut and a glazed with chocolate.  They weren't oily and too heavy.  The combination of a bite of the donut and chasing it with the latte was good.  The mug was unique as well.Overall impression:I enjoyed the Crab Toast with lemon aioli the most, could have had 2 in lieu of the other appetizer! The set up of the restaurant is very romantic and definitely date worthy.  I liked their utensils, the bowls, and mugs.  I would return."
Always H.,"Manhattan, NY",1/28/2015,4 star rating,"I go on dates just to have an excuse to come here for the salted caramel ice cream topped with popcorn and warm rich chocolate.   Addictive. Insanely so.Haven't yet had the pizza, but everything else is so good.  I predictably start with the crab toast.  Followed by the shaved fluke -- clean and fresh. In order of preference, the sea bass, lobster, cod, suckling pig.  Get the Brussels sprouts! ALWAYS finish with the salted caramel sundae.Great service, as is the ambiance. Nice wine selection.  Only issue is that last time the food was uncharacteristically subpar -- from the over seasoned fluke to the underwhelming pork. I'm hoping that was just an aberration.  Regardless, the salted caramel sundae makes everything worth it..."
Anie R.,"Miami, FL",9/8/2015,3 star rating,I forgot to give my review about this place that I've been wanting to go to for years now and finally did over the summer actually a month ago!Well let's just say I liked it. Would I come back yes but if I don't get around to it then I don't.It's nice to go at least once. I actually like the decorations & ambiance more then the food but not saying the food was bad it wasn't.But I least I now can say I've been here.
Yolanda L.,"Manhattan, NY",3/2/2016,4 star rating,"What a lovely restaurant -- intimate, cozy with sophisticated guests. We ordered crab toast, cauliflower as appetizers and sea bass, mushroom sides, ended with their signature caramel ice cream. Everything tastes amazing.Pros: ideal for vegetarian, healthy and organic food, light but full of flavor; service is personal.Cons: it is noisy though. We made a reservation a month ago for 7PM weekday dinner.Overall: recommend. Healthy and tasty food, great service."
Ankita B.,"New York, NY",1/5/2016,4 star rating,"Came here to kick start 2016 with good food. Thumbs up for the ambience and hospitality offered by the staff. The table top decor, white space and the rustic looks makes it a perfect place for a romantic date. For food, we ordered the ricotta ravioli for appetiser which was delectable and perfect. For entree, my husband called for a chicken dish which he found very impressive. I called for the mushroom pizza, which I think could be better as it got too soggy after l could relish my first slice."
H C.,"New York, NY",11/18/2015,4 star rating,"Definitely going back! Staff was incredibly friendly and helpful whenever needed and food was very fresh! We had to make a reservation a couple weeks in advance so make sure you check in with them to reserve a few weeks before you plan on going! Our waitress was really helpful in assisting with our menu choices. Went with a girlfriend and we ordered a bunch of different things--everything was great! The squash toast was delicious, assorted beans side was good (nothing so special), ravioli was amazing and the halibut was great as well! Best part of the meal was the chocolate cake!! So delicious! Ambiance is good--we felt like we were in the 1990's with the plates and decor but it adds to the homey atmosphere. Definitely goes with their vibe and farm to table/sustainable cuisine."
James N.,"Philadelphia, PA",1/2/2018,5 star rating,Blown away by our meal here. The decor was cozy but modern. Great service too. Pork confit and the basil pistachio pesto on fettuccine were simply amazing.
Alexandra C.,"New York, NY",11/26/2011,4 star rating,"ABC Kitchen take 2 - the verdict:  Not as good.We tried all different dishes this time, except for the beet yogurt salad.  This was still the 5 star all time best beet salad around.The carrot and avocado salad was good - with cumin flavored carrots, not too much avocado and other greens.  Wouldn't order it again but it was good/different to try.The crab toast - this we ordered because the table next to us had it last time we were there and it looked incredible.  This time it didn't seem to look the same and it was nothing special.  At the high price tag, a definite skip.Roasted cauliflower with farm egg, walnuts.  Complaint- hardly any walnuts, which were what made the dish once one appeared.  Other complaint - tiny pieces of cauliflower were black burnt crumbs throughout the dish - this completely ruined the flavor.  This was the biggest and most filling dish, but definitely not one to order again.Hake and cabbage entree -- this was good.  Cabbage was done perfectly.  Nothing spectacular with this dish, but not bad either.Besides the beet salad, everything else sort of let us down this time around.Was last here in the summer and the sea bass and pasta dish with summer vegetables were both extraordinary.  Will give it another shot in spring/summer for one of those fresh pasta dishes....."
Lisa S.,"New York, NY",11/12/2017,5 star rating,"Came here for brunch on Sunday. It was crowded and wait was about an hour (we had a reservation - definitely make one!) the decor is great, eclectic furniture, lighting and dishes (not a huge fan of the lighting though). The food was incredible and very flavorful. The bread was great, we loved the kobacha squash and ricotta toast, the cheeseburger (perfectly cooked and so much flavor) and the pancakes with homemade lemon curd. Great service as well! Highly recommend!"
Beatrice W.,"New York, NY",12/3/2014,4 star rating,"Trendy and fashionable place, not my usual favorite but I have to admit that the staff was sweet and the burger perfect. Might be one of the best burger I have had. Lobster is cooked perfectly but nothing out of this world, same for the mashed potatoes. Dessert with Salted butter caramel and popcorn was exciting.Overall a very nice dinner !!!"
Lu H.,"New York, NY",12/1/2011,4 star rating,"Update after dinner for 3 where everything was split  -- some things are still great and some were not so much.    They do a nice job splitting shared dishes for you.WINS:- Fried Chicken:  Huge, juicy, light and crispy on the outside, almost like tempura batter but even finer.  Delicious, and enough to fill up 2 people as entrees.  Collard greens on bottom and a sauce that was a little spicy, but thats it.  The chicken is the real star of the dish, and I liked that simplicity.  - Suckling pig:  A surprisingly smaller portion.  It was a rectangular cut of pork with some sweet chunks on top from the plum and bacon marmalade.  It was good but everyone liked the chicken more. - Prune pizza:  Take a gamble on these pizzas - they're good, creative, and unusual and will give your jaded New-Yorker taste buds a nice surprise.  This was the special pizza of the night, and we went for it because it sounded unappetizing.  I've learned from past experience here that the stranger sounding the pizza is the more delicious it is (ie clam pizza.  mm.).  The prune pizza came with endives and proscuitto - the combination of sweet prune and salty proscuitto was delicious.   - Roasted butternut squash - Mmm.  Good comfort winter vegetable especially roasted.- Chicken Liver Toast - Yummy.  Satisfying, light, crunch toast.  Nicely done.  BOOS:- Roasted beets with housemade yogurt: I love beets, but not sure why I read raving reviews about this dish.  Beets tasted very ordinary -- the yogurt was fine but didn't really enhance the beets in any way.  Left me dreaming of the beets with goat heese and pistachio dish at Purple Pig in Chicago.  Now THAT was a beet dish.- Crab Toast with Lemon Aioli:  This was a let-down.   I LOVED the Peekytoe crab toast appetizer the previous two times I was here.  I guess this is just regular ol' crab.  It didn't taste like much.  SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN:- Salted Caramel Sundae: I remember this as being amazing.  It was still pretty good this time, but wasn't as awesome as the first time.  Pretty generous dessert - 3 scoops of caramel ice cream with judge and popcorn.  Flavors still go well together, and isn't too sweet.- Scallops: Special appetizer of the night.  Good but nothing special.  - Brussels Sprouts: Roasted until blacked on outside and tender inside.  Decent side, but I've had much better brussels sprouts. Am I still a fan of this place?  Absolutely!  I still love the atmosphere, the space, the relaxed but efficient service -- definitely a fun spot to have dinner if you're not into stuffiness.  And the food, for the most part, is still very good.  It just may have lost a touch of its initial luster.  What's left is still a solid choice in the Union Square area for an upscale but reasonable dinner."
Tara E.,"Toronto, Canada",2/17/2012,5 star rating,"This meal was incredible. The only downside is I tried to make reservations more than a week in advance, and all that was available was 10:00pm on a Monday night. Fine. I took advantage and hopped to two bars before arriving. However we (drunkenly) had trouble finding the entrance, and arrived at 10:13. The hostess refused to seat us because we were late! Now let me tell you, if you make me wait until 10pm to have dinner I will be STARVING. If you don't feed me I might cry. Luckily with some (insistent) sweet talking (and the swooping in of a friendly gentleman who seemed above them in the workplace hierarchy) we were seated. (Note. Don't be late.)We ordered Mushroom Toast, the Roast Suckling Pig, a pizza with radicchio, prosciutto and dates (Y.U.M.), as well as the donuts and pear crumble for dessert. I did see a waiter drop one of my donuts on the floor... I'm pretty sure they didn't serve it to me. So that's a positive. The food was spectacular. The pizza was BLOW MY MIND good. I can't wait to try this combination of flavours at home. Yes, I was a little bit tipsy, and that might taint the review, but everything was really delicious. I appreciated that they split the suckling pig entree for us onto two separate plates without us asking.The boy put it in his top 5 meals we have had together. Period. So that's saying something.We expected the meal to come to more than it did. It helped that we had already had a few drinks (and 3 plates of oysters), so we shared a few things, and only had a glass of wine each, but compared to a few other spectacular meals I have had (Sky Room in San Diego for example) the cost was significantly less. It rang in for about $120. It wasn't a huge amount of food, but it was enough."
Tony K.,"Brooklyn, NY",2/21/2018,2 star rating,"What's happened ABC??? Seems ABC, like many of Jean Georges older restaurants, is stepping back from what made it great, casual but attentive service and meticulous attention to the food. On a recent visit both missed the mark. A favorite, crab toast, was peppered with crab shell, a lazy oversight, but one that made it inedible. Service was clumsy, after asking repeatedly for lemon, none ever came, and a bottle of wine ordered far before the mains, arrived well after our entire table had finished. If the sommelier had put the same time into prompt service that he had into grooming his mustache... well, we would have had wine with our meal. It's disappointing to see such a great place resting on its laurels, the fear is weather or not it will ever be able to get back up."
Emily F.,"Los Angeles, CA",12/29/2014,5 star rating,"ABC kitchen is everything you want in a dining experience: good service, great ambiance and decor, interesting and unique venue, amazing food. I spent a weekend in NYC, and my friend and I scored reservations here at 9pm on Friday Dec.26. We arrived a bit earlier than our reservation, and only had to wait a few minutes before being seated. Considering what a popular night in Manhattan this is, I was pleasantly surprised. It was packed!I was immediately struck by what a classy place this is, while still being unpretentious. A large warehouse space, ABC kitchen reflects the home and decor side of the operation with interesting chandeliers, dinnerware, and wall decor. In terms of service, our waiter was attentive, though a bit rough around the edges at times (read: snob). The woman refilling our drinks and clearing our table was more pleasant.Ok, food. I'm used to the whole urban farm to table theme since that's a huge trend in LA, and a trend that I appreciate, so I was excited for some interesting combinations of ingredients. I wasn't disappointed. Here are our eats:MARKET TABLE: House made ricotta, cranberry compote, and grilled bread [$15]: My friend got this, and really loved it. I tasted the ricotta and cranberry compote, and literally could have eaten the entire plate myself if my friend let me. The ricotta was so fresh and creamy, I don't think I've had better tasting ricotta. I didn't taste the bread, but my friend commented that it was a little too charred. Roasted kabocha squash toast, fresh ricotta, and apple cider vinegar [$15]: I was drawn to this because I love kabocha squash, and of course ricotta. I was afraid it was going to be boring since it's just squash and toast. But, the second I tasted it, all fear disappeared -- it was delicious!! The combination of kabocha squash with apple cider, and the creamy texture of the ricotta with the crunch of the toast made this really fun to eat! ENTREES:Sautéed skuna salmon, sweet carrot sauce, roasted carrots and basil [$31]: I was really looking forward to getting fish at ABC kitchen since they pay close attention to how their food is source, and where it comes from (meaning, super fresh and tasty fish). The salmon was cooked medium raw and was perfectly tender. The sweet carrot sauce was a nice accompaniment to the subtle flavor of the salmon, and the carrots were charred and sweet. Not a single bite left!Crispy pork confit, smoked bacon marmalade and braised turnips [$35]: I can't say much about this since I didn't taste it, but my friend couldn't stop raving about this dish. The bacon marmalade was on point, every morsel devoured.SIDE:Wood oven roasted sunchokes with hazelnuts and herbs [$12]: I pushed this side on my friend a bit! I love sunchokes and can never find them in LA, so I jumped at the chance to get them. They were really tasty - roasted just enough so they're crispy, yet still tender. I loved the additional of the hazelnuts.DESSERT:Sundae with salted caramel ice cream, and popcorn [$14]: I was least impressed with this. While it was still clearly tasty, and the whipped cream fresh as can be, I was expecting something a bit more interesting. It really is just salted caramel ice cream, whipped cream, and popcorn.DRINKS:We both got the special cocktail for the night. I can't exactly remember what was in it, but it was a combo of vodka, ginger, lemon, apple juice, and some other tasty things. It was delicious, so much so we got another round [$15].Total: basically $200. This place isn't cheap (but what place is in NYC?), but the quality of the food, and the venue really are stand outs, and I didn't mind dropping the cash on a place with such high standards.All in all, ABC kitchen hit all the marks. If I could score another reservation here, I would go back in a heart beat. There are so many interesting sounding dishes on their menu!"

Donna A.,"Brooklyn, NY",1/18/2015,4 star rating,"Eating organic is not cheap, but there is something quite satisfying about eating fresh, locally sourced ingredients.  Let's be real, your pockets will be mad at you but your taste buds will forever be indebted to you. The basil lime daquiri was so strong and delicious and the bites we had were to die for.  It's not a stifled environment at all and I look forward to going back for a full meal."

Monica L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",4/12/2018,1 star rating,Overcharge but after a week they pay me backBe aware!!!! They overcharge. I had lunch with my friend last week and I paid them 36 but they actually charged me 39.75???? I would not know it if I didn't check my bank statement. Even contact them are there any error? Just one person forward email and said someone will help you but  no one responsible for it! No one!!!!!Worst customer service!!!!!!!!!
Sookie B.,"Key Biscayne, FL",12/19/2015,4 star rating,"Always a classic.  Have been coming here for years & not only is it a great atmosphere & space, but food is consistently great.  Highlights include the Kabocha Squash toast (perfect on it's own; don't recommend ordering this and the carrots/avocado salad in one sitting as the roasted carrots are much too sweet/similar in flavor for one sitting); the cheeseburger; French toast (don't judge it by how strange it looks)."
Elena V.,"New York, NY",9/19/2010,4 star rating,"Love the space and breezy atmosphere as much as the idea of sustainable food.  Was not that impressed with the actual menu however. I practically burned my tongue on the halibut so asked politely if I could send it back as there was no mention of any spice on the menu. Waiter insisted it was not spicy and thought I was crazy but agreed to take it back. It was returned sans spice so obviously they were able to pinpoint the culprit.  Melon bellinis unfortunately sound more delicious than they actually taste and while the pizza was good there's nothing special about it.  The highlight of my meal were the market strawberries with meringue, mint and lime.  Very refreshing with just the right amount of sweetness. I also sampled a chocolate cake which was pretty generic/dull.  Still giving this place four stars for the idea, ambiance, location, and the fun options for drinks, desserts, and teas.*Note: No reception with T-mobile in the dining room. You can get one or two bars in the bathroom or just step outside. Can get quite frustrating."
Kamshim L.,"New York, NY",12/16/2010,4 star rating,"This is such a cute and pretty pretty restaurant! Not to mention the amazing food, it is the perfect place to eat and catch up with friends. Book at least a week ahead for a table because the reservation times in opentable run out really quickly!Ordering the crab toast was a no brainer after reading all the hype over it on yelp. And this delectable appetizer was certainly worth the hype!!! I'm a big fan of seafood so I really appreciated the fresh taste of the crab. The crab is delicately garnished so as to enhance its flavor and the addition of crunchy toast makes this little genius a sure winner :) We only ordered the crab toast but I will definitely return to try the squash/white bean versions. For the entree I had the portabello sandwich which was good but it didn't blow my mind. Now to the important finale: the. salted. caramel. ice-cream. sundae. The finishing creation with popcorn and peanut sprinkles makes it a bowl of sweet creamy deliciousness. But I felt that the ice cream was simply amazing by itself. The portion is huge (bowl almost the size of my head) but I could easily finish the whole thing myself (but this is coming from a girl who can eat ice cream for dinner....). When I ordered it, my friend was pretty full and said she would take a bite or two (yeah right, this NEVER happens haha). Once the ice cream arrived, what ended up was a ceasing of conversation and a concentrated attack upon the ice cream. If I could, I would buy pints of these, stuff them in my freezer and live off them for the rest of winter. Yay for toast and ice cream!!! :D"
Cristine D.,"Carlstadt, NJ",12/19/2015,5 star rating,"Good was excellent We ordered the crab toast and the raviolis as an appetizer, both amazing.The raviolis were melting in our mouthThe drinks pretty good too!!"
Briana W.,"Hoboken, NJ",4/20/2017,4 star rating,"Came here for brunch with 2 of my friends and got seated at a high top table. Overall this place is beautiful and I loved the decor. We each ordered our own brunch meals, and decided to split 2 orders of the cheddar biscuits. Our waitress said ""today we have strawberry jam, would that be ok?"" We said sure and our came the biscuits with some jam and butter. The food was great and the service was also good. Out comes the check and she charged us for the ""jam"". It ended up being $6. I am giving 4 stars because I don't appreciate the sneakiness, and she could have at least told us we would be charged for the jam. I would come back here."
Priya R.,"Washington, DC",8/19/2017,4 star rating,"Came here for Sunday brunch (make a reservation!) and was not disappointed. The angel hair with saffron, golden garlic, jalapeños, herbs and fresh ricotta was so simple but had really nuanced flavors and a subtle kick from the peppers - incredible. I actually changed my mind and ordered this after hearing our waitress's description, and the entree size ($25) was a solid, filling portion. It comes in olive oil and our waitress suggested mixing it all together with the ricotta so create its own kind of sauce. My friend ordered the scrambled eggs with crispy oysters and hot sauce butter, which we were told they sell out of every brunch time. Again, perfectly soft-scrambled eggs with deceptively deep flavors. We started with the seasonal glazed donuts to share (one chocolate, one berry), which I would definitely skip next time as they were somewhat lackluster, especially at $10 for two. The glaze was good but the donuts themselves were small and slightly dry. Overall however a deliciously satisfying experience in a beautiful space."
Jessica P.,"Manhattan, NY",1/25/2015,5 star rating,"Outstanding, clean, delicious food.  Also, the service is superb. The portions may seem small at first but after all courses you will feel satisfied and not stuffed.We started with the ricotta cranberry toasts which we thought would be sweet but turned out to be a pleasant, creamy tart. Also the pistachio-pesto fettuccine was a good starter but I will admit the half portion was not enough for sharing!For entrees we had mostly fish.  I ordered the cod which was perfectly cooked and dancing in a creamy cauli mash.  My mom had the bass which was also delicately cooked and perched upon a nest of spinach.  My bestie had the salmon which was flavorful and prepared with a hint of sweetness and a hint of heat.  My dad had the special - a date and prosciutto pizza - which he dared say is the best pizza he has ever had, ever. For dessert we shared the doughnut platter and the almond cake - both were great!!Did not try the wines this time around but will definitely return.... stay tuned!!"
Saarah S.,"Playa Del Rey, CA",12/22/2014,5 star rating,"WOW! Can I say WOW!  I loved everything I had at this place!  Super fresh and yummy!!!  The ambiance is really great too!!  It's super calm, collected, and very professional.  I didn't feel crammed in, even despite the fact that the place was crowded.   The crab appetizer, butternut squash soup...salad....etc...all really yummy!  Everything has different tastes in each dish that you normally wouldn't find at other places...and IT'S AWESOME! I def would come here again for sure!!"
Bridget R.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",3/25/2017,3 star rating,"Came in to Abc Kitchen for late night dessert & wine after a movie. Seated at the bar, had to ask for water, a menu & wine then continued to be ignored by bar staff for the remainder of our time. Ordered 2 desserts which were very average (brulee & pavlova) - brulee was the better of the two. Overall a disappointing experiance."
Josh M.,"New York, NY",11/29/2014,3 star rating,"This restaurant has a really amazing menu but fails to deliver on the details that should be expected given its reputation. The physical space is amazing and well-curated. The menu, as I mentioned, seems great and appetizing -- my wife and I wanted to try practically every dish. We had a reservation and were seated promptly and courteously. Service was relatively quick. Prices were reasonable for the market, ingredient quality, and reputation.And yet, it seems ABC Kitchen disappoints each time on a detail. It was the rare occasion for my wife and I that we seriously considered sending back a dish or two. A few examples to illustrate what we found to be true:My market lettuce salad had a delightful dressing that was quite enjoyable, but was sprinkled in the kitchen with far too much cracked black pepper -- the pepper became the dominant flavor. My salmon entree later suffered from touches of the same problem. Hold off on the pepper folks!Our brussels sprout side dish was so overcooked the sprouts were squishy and even the waitress noticed and took it off our bill. Nevertheless, my wife and I enjoyed the friend chicken, mushroom toast without complaint and we'd recommend both.I ordered a glass of a sweeter white wine, and is often the case with these less-popular wines, the wine was over-chilled and the bottle didn't get enough turnover.As I noted at the outset, we simply expected more. ABC Kitchen touts their local and carefully curated ingredient sources and a preparation that truly lets those ingredients shine would be best.Final note: we went the Friday evening after Thanksgiving. I would have expected service to be consistent if not superior given it was a Friday evening. But perhaps holiday staff scheduling made things difficult?"

Serena C.,"New York, NY",12/7/2015,5 star rating,I came here for brunch on Sunday. I had to make reservation 2 weeks in advance. The food is definitely solid and I will come back to try their dinner menu.
Christine G.,"Northern, VA",1/30/2016,5 star rating,Great ambiance and decor. Service is top notch and food is tasty. Lots of gluten free and paleo friendly options as well. Reservations require a few week lead time for Friday and Saturday so book several weeks ahead. Well worth it.
Jerry K.,"ASTORIA, NY",11/30/2014,5 star rating,"I can't rave about this place enough. I kid you not, I found this place looking for a lobster lunch and after asking a few friends if they heard about it, their eyes just filled with glee. That was enough to to RSVP for lunch.The decor is wonderful and the place is immense. Do not take the large number of seating lightly as this place is well known to have a wait time. We were seated immediately in the well lit large wooden bench Victorian decorated dining room.Meal started with crab on toast, a dish that sounds simple but has wonderfully complex flavors. The lobsters as a main course comes deshelled with the middle split in half. Lightly charred to give the meat a bit of soft texture.Home made sodas kept us trying out new flavors during our meal.Caramel ice cream for desert was big enough for sharing. This was a real treat as the ice cream is served just at the right temp putting a large smile on my friends face at the end of the meal.From the host, to the waiter, to the coat check everyone is up beat and kind. Making ABC Kitchen truly feel as it's you own."

Decor was unreal.Perfect spot for a date, or a night out with the friends.I love how they split the food into dishes for you!Service was great, waiter was very tentative.Food was on point, my only complaint is that if your gonna charge me $32 for an order of salmon, please make it bigger then my thumb finger. It was ridiculous small yo.Deff comin back here."
Emmeline H.,"Manhattan, NY",12/2/2015,4 star rating,"Truly unique menu, particularly with the starters. Pretzel dusted calamari was a favorite at our table, as was the cheese plate. The flatbreads were delicious as well. The ambiance was particularly charming, with the mismatched plates standing out and providing a source of conversation.

Sorry I am afraid to order anything special. It was my birthday so my girlfriend took me to this place, but oh boy I did not leave happy. I was happy because of my girlfriend but I was not happy with what ABC have offered. No more ABC for me."
Masumi T.,"New York, NY",9/30/2011,3 star rating,"I came here with high expectations.  I think I would describe the decor as upscale industrial.  It is very clean but with interesting accents like the aged mirror.  My family and I tried peekytoe crab toast, bowtie pasta, mackerel sashimi, pork belly over radish salad, and a white fish entree.  The pork belly was crispy and nice but nothing was very memorable.  A friend told me the peekytoe toast is phenomenal but I found it a bit fishy.  The highlight of the evening was the sundae.  It tasted like a deconstructed snickers bar -- salted caramel ice cream, candied peanuts, chocolate sauce and popcorn."

Audrey K.,"New York, NY",3/22/2012,5 star rating,"This place is what the inside of my brain looks like. I want to live here, wed here, and die here. The little details really make ABC Kitchen a very special place.The mismatching dishes, tiny vases of real flower buds and the delicate flavors and sights make it an experience, not just a meal.I will say that it is so girly, and dainty, so I don't know how great it'd go over with a group of dudes on any given Wednesday (as opposed to an occasion) but it is the perrrfect place for a girls date. The back room has a gorgeous chandelier, a view of the kitchen, I prefer it a lot to the larger main room.The food is also so delicately prepared, the lemon aioli crab toast is delicious and perfect - you will for sure want to pop your pinky. The herby pizza has a hearty amount of sea salt on it, but there is a great bitterness from the herbs that goes perfect with the chewy bread.Definitely don't be scared to experiment, their menu seems to be practiced and perfected. I think the coffee was a thumbs down, and took quite a while - though I was warned that the barista was very busy.Something I also appreciated a lot: while waiting for a table, you can SEE all the delicious looking food being served, but you cannot/will not smell it! How the ventilation is set up in this place, I am not sure - but it preserves the whole feel of the place. It would not be as perfectly packaged if garlic, pizza and other smells were bombarding your senses.Can't wait to go back, will definitely look into how to hold an event here, am already preparing to replicate little details for my home!"

We have a party of three and we ordered a white wine from Hudson valley, three dishes of fish- salmon, black bass and hake. We didn't do appetizer but we ordered a peach pie. The service is great and the food is really delicious, but I think the restaurant is overrated. If you haven't been, it's worth a try."
Sheena V.,"Nashville, TN",5/31/2012,5 star rating,"This place was FANTASTIC for lunch!  The ambiance was great - the restaurant appears so nondescript from the outside, but it's pretty large inside.  Very cute set up.  Great for dates, catch up sessions with friends, or for visiting family/friends.My friend and I ordered an appetizer each, an entree, and then split a dessert.  I ordered the house fries, which were amazing.  The crispy garlic was a great touch!  For the main entree, I ordered the ravioli and my friend got the raviolo.  Both dishes were a great blend of ingredients.  We got the caramel popcorn sundae for dessert - a MUST try!The portion sizes are pretty small, and the price is pretty steep, but the food/service/ambiance definitely makes the experience worth it!  I would love to try this place for dinner some time, too!"
Mina Y.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",6/30/2018,3 star rating,"This would be a 5 star review if the food were a little more affordable. The dishes are obviously fantastic, but the portions are small and if feels like you're paying designer prices for an okay dish. I think there are other Jean George restaurants that are well worth it based on quality of food and price. This place is one of those spots you go to once to say you've been there. Or you come here for a special occasion or on a first date because the decor is obviously quite enjoyable."
Jemma C.,"New York, NY",7/23/2015,4 star rating,Really enjoyed my experience here. From the staff to the decor to the drinks and food. We had lunch and i think I was expecting miracles/ life altering food as I've been so excited to try it. It was very good. Life changing? No.We'll be back for dinner soon to see if it lives up to the hype and hopefully will post a 5 star review.
Jennifer D.,"Sebastopol, CA",10/21/2016,4 star rating,"A stunning space, romantically lit, brilliantly (and minimally) decorated, with wonderful service and delicious food.They were great about holding our table for us as we were running late (silly non-locals, thinking they can get anywhere in a reasonable amount of time in an Uber), everyone was friendly and not at all pretentious.  This is one of those spots where there are basically three people assisting with any given table - waters were always filled, plates always cleared. . . in the beginning at least.I found that our dinner here was a bit like hooking up with that dreamboat that said and did all the right things until they got you where they wanted you, and then rolled over and went to sleep like you weren't even there.  Our food came out fast and furious. . . . and then slightly less so. . . and then we wondered if our server may have gone home, and if we'd ever see a dessert menu, or the bill. . .  Luckily, we were enjoying each others company, and the beauty of the space, and the deliciousness of the food, so it was only an oddity (based on the abundance of attention in the beginning), more than an annoyance.  Though I would have loved to order another drink, I still had a great time.The stand out dishes for me were the kabocha squash and ricotta toast (the bread and olive oil to start was fantastic too actually), and the mushroom bolognese.  The fluke was great (once you scraped the copious amounts of horseradish off), the housemade sausage had a flavor I can't put my finger on which drove me nuts. The fried chicken was unlike any other fried chicken I've ever encountered - pan seared I think, and then fried in a super light and lacy batter with a spicy-tangy sauce on the plate.  The sea bass was amazing when it first came out with its super crisp skin which softened over time, but that's to be expected, it's sitting in broth - eat it quickly!  The dandelion greens were delicious too.  If you're as gluttonous as we are, you'd be crazy to miss the chocolate cake, and/or the apple pie to wrap things up.  Both were great.I wish we had finished earlier so I could have drooled my way through ABC Home instead of just pressing myself up against the windows outside and going home with Fishs Eddy instead."

Nikita K.,"New York, NY",7/21/2015,4 star rating,"I visited for brunch on Saturday. The eggs were nicely scrambled, my friend had the French toast which really resembled a cake but tasted amazing. The food is simple, presentation minimal, but the flavors and quality are what standout. Yes my brunch photos looked a bit sad compared to my friend's photos from Sarabeth's, but I'd pick ABC Kitchen over most other brunch spots every day.The coffees are nice and they have soy milk; as per usual the glassware, plates etc. are all available for purchase at their shop at the back, which makes the experience all the more costly. Although one could argue the advantages of testing out the glasses and plates before buying. My only complaint would be that the music was SO loud. It was difficult to hear everyone at the table. Can't wait to visit again."
Michael A.,"Jersey City, NJ",2/9/2012,4 star rating,Came here for a prefix lunch menuService was great from the start.  Very Attentive.I started with a velvety cauliflower soup which had some hidden spicy elements.  Very tasty and light.The entree was a delicious ravioli stuffed ricotta and a whole egg yolk.  The egg yolk is pleasant surprise when you first cut in. The ravioli is on top of a savory pork ragu.  You're going to need more bread to slop it up. I had the cookie plate for desert which I couldn't finish but was a perfect end to a perfect lunch.Will come back for dinner.
Lauren B.,"Toronto, Canada",5/29/2013,4 star rating,"ABC lives up to the hype...don't miss the caramel ice cream/popcorn/chococlate sauce dessert thing. Awesome!We showed up on a Friday night at 8 without reservations...we were told our options were to wait for seats at the bar or wait for a high-top table (in the front bar area) to become available. We told them either option would work...and we probably only waited about 15-20 minutes for a high top, which wasn't so bad since we were able to sit along the wall and order cocktails in the meantime.(Obviously, if you're keen to sit at a normal table with the rest of the well-heeled, trendy crowd that comes to ABC, make a reservation at least a couple of weeks in advance! The high-top was okay but definitely not the full ABC experience.)Food/ambience/service was excellent. No wonder this is one of NYC's hottest restaurants!"
Amy H.,"El Sobrante, CA",8/29/2016,4 star rating,"Beautiful restaurant, delicious food from start to finish and friendly service! I came here with my sister for a late dinner and we ordered the calamari appetizer, fettuccine with pistachio pesto, the pork confit, corn (side dish), sparkling fuji apple and ginger juice, and the blueberry lemon trifle for dessert. We mentioned that we were going to share everything and, to our surprise, our entrees came already divided into individual bowls. Very sweet that the server remembered we were sharing. Also, ask for bread and they'll bring you some. The calamari comes with a mustard aioli (not a fan) and a tasty spicy tomato sauce. That was a hit! The main attraction was definitely the pasta. Pistachio pesto over thick fettuccine with green beans, tomatoes and sprinkled with Parmesan. So delicious and flavorful! Must try. The pork confit was yummy as well, crispy and flavorful. The beets that came with it were so good too! I'm usually not a fan of beets but this changed my mind. The blueberry lemon trifle was okay, not bad not excellent. I must mention, the service is really good. Water was refilled constantly, plates were cleared in a timely manner, the table was always kept clean and tidy by servers, and they were so friendly. Also it's really dark in here, I could barely see the menu. they have small lights and candles on every table. I understand it's to set the ambience so it's not a huge issue, just more of a ""don't forget to bring your flashlight"" tip, lol."
Mamatha R.,"Atlanta, GA",11/15/2015,5 star rating,"You definitely need reservations for weekend visit.  This place was full when I visited with my friends for brunch.  As soon as we walked into the restaurant, we felt we were transported into elegance - the lighting was soft and chandeliers were antique looking and so pretty.  They had a beautiful autumn harvest set up which provided the seasonal ambience.  The staff was exceptionally courteous.  everything we ordered was great!! Their veggie burger (chick pea based) was one of the better ones that I have tasted ...it had a little sweet potato mixed in it...beets with yogurt, and mushrooms with garlic (yum!)..the lobster was so tender and the ravioli was looking pretty with a saffronish/gold hue."
Elyse M.,"New York, NY",7/12/2015,5 star rating,"This place lives up to all it's hype. Let me get right down to business. THE FRIED CHICKEN is AMAZING. It comes on top of collard greens in a hot sauce drawn butter. I will die for that chicken. But let me actually start from the beginning. During the Fall season, they have an appetizer called the Kaboucha Squash Toast that will blow your mind. It is one of the best things that I have ever tasted.  During the Spring, the ramp toast is also delicious, and all year round the crab toast is a sure bet.  The fluke also stands out for another small dish. The carrot avocado salad is nice and fresh, and those carrots are really special.  I had a glass of Sancere that was the perfect fit for these dishes. On to entrees. Like I said, the chicken. Next, the pork is amazing, and so is the lobster. Both are very, very good dishes. The mashed potatoes and the Brussels sprouts are nice sides to accompany these entrees. The Ricotta Ravioli is amazing. I've never had ravioli like that and neither has my super Italian friend that has had it the two times he's dined there. For dessert, the Caramel Sundae is a Jean-George's staple, and very good. My favorite dessert is the Almond Cake. Ohhhh the almond cake is so good.       The service here is top notch. God forbid my water glass should be empty must be a motto of theirs. The servers and backwaiters are very knowledgable, and the managers make sure that this place runs like a well oiled machine. I've dined here about 8 times, and I always leave with my calendar out, planning my next visit.  This place is truly special, and absolutely BEAUTIFUL."
Claire K.,"Westlake Village, CA",1/1/2018,5 star rating,"The service was amazing and the food was even better! The atmosphere of the restaurant was fun and lively. The service was great and our waitress was fun and gave us very great guidance on what to get and her guidance did not disappoint. Next time I am in New York, this will be the first place I am coming for dinner and you should too!"
J B.,"San Antonio, TX",12/15/2014,5 star rating,"That same night some other friends met us for dinner at ABC Kitchen. Besides the fact that they took a huge old building and made it warm and whimsical, everything about the place was to die for. The staff was so kind, the food was to die for and even my birthday dessert was so beautiful I was so thrilled. What we shared Mushroom toast, pecorino, lemon and herbs, housemate ricotta, cranberry compote and grilled bread, pear and apple salad, blue cheese dressing, fines herbs and candied pecans, fried organic chicken with collard greens and hot sauce butter, roasted cod with cauliflower, crushed herbs, and lime...what a fabulous birthday...from beginning to end!"
Elle W.,"Oakland, CA",7/22/2014,4 star rating,"Best brunch ever.  My god, Jean Georges - why do you rock so much?Between the two juices, the one with ginger was much more tasty.  My friend ordered ""Mellow Love"" and it tasted like grass.  Crab Toast - deliciousTuna sashimi - flavorfulSmoked salmon with craime fraiche - satisfyingThe only ""miss"" was the kale salad, but that's more because my friend ended up eating more than half of my smoked salmon.  I'm knocking down one star for the decor.  I'm not a fan of how sterile & white the interior is.  The space is already windowless, which highlights the lack of warmth."
Gurkiran G.,"Akron, OH",12/30/2017,5 star rating,"We had an amazing time at ABC kitchen. The food was definitely extraordinary and one-of-a-kind never had the entrées the way they had them set up here. Food was amazing dessert was really really good. Would strongly recommend the recorder ravioli, the chicken was fabulous. The staff was amazing manager came around numerous times to make sure we had everything and we were doing well. And they were very flexible when we had to push our reservations by 30 minutes and didn't give us any issues! Will def go back!!"
Danielle D.,"Austin, TX",2/28/2016,5 star rating,"I know my review may pale in comparison to the thousands already written by established Manhattan foodies, but I'll give it a shot.We did our research. Definitely get the ricotta/cranberry on grilled bread, carrot salad (amazing) and the crab toast. I got the chicken entree, he got the lobster. What really set ABC Kitchen apart from the rest was the service.Our server's name was Emily. Not only was she incredibly professional and accommodating, but she went above and beyond to make our experience perfect. We shared with her that we were trying to get a reservation for Valentine's day, without success. When it came to dessert, we told her we were torn between the chocolate cake and the apple pie. We talked it out and we decided on the cake. To our pleasant surprise, she brought both desserts out for us. This was so incredibly kind and we won't forget this experience -- we will certainly be back Highly, highly recommended."
Cece Y.,"San Francisco, CA",11/15/2014,3 star rating,"Food: 3Ambiance: 3.5 to 4Service: 4I don't know what all the hubbub is about.  The food was seriously only OK:-Kasha And Bowtie Pasta, Veal Meatballs: Meh.  Heavy on the sauce, which tasted like sweet onion jam and a hint of BBQ sauce.  The appetizer portion is sizeable though, and always includes 5 meatballs.-Brussels sprouts, garlic, jalapenos and lemon Pizza: Everyone agreed CPK pizza tastes way better. -Fettucine pasta dish (can't remember name): Also just ok.-Salted caramel ice cream Sundae: Delicious!!  My favorite part of the dinner.  The sweet, crunchy peanuts were awesome.  But honestly, it's hard to screw up ice cream, and this was SO simple, I'm positive I could very easily recreate this at home with Haagen Daaz, hot fudge, and Cracker Jacks. The restaurant front is unassuming, so you've probably passed by a hundred times and not known it.  The place is much more spacious than I had imagined, which is nice, but also made me wonder why it's always been difficult to get a reservation unless you do so far in advance.  The restaurant was half-empty during the early evening hours on a weekday.  For such a large space, there's also only 2 BR stalls in the women's room.  Prepare to wait!The service was great though.  It's also good for groups as they have the space to accommodate it.  But I say check out other places for actually good food!"
Brad H.,"Tallahassee, FL",12/28/2017,4 star rating,Solid and fresh food options for lunch. The squash soup and squash toasts are to die for....nice diversion for a mid-day lunch although a bit pricey.
Rachel U.,"Portland, OR",8/27/2014,5 star rating,"Soooo happy to have been able to dine here while I was in town, let alone on my birthday! My amazing friend snagged reservations only a few days prior so I knew I had to make it worthwhile.The entire restaurant looks like the front cover of a West Elm catalog. Everything from the mismatched plates to the flower arrangements and the distressed white wood tables looked perfect.We were seated in a communal table but the other party left shortly after we sat down and it stayed empty for the rest of the night (lucky us). We started with drinks and I ordered their summer jam cocktail which I gulped down seconds.  It was light, not too sweet, and refreshing.  I usually have bad luck when it comes to restaurant cocktails so I was super pleased with this one.We ordered basil pizza as an appetizer and it was so fresh and delicious! The pizza was covered with basil but it wasn't overbearing at all.For my main dish I had the ricotta ravioli and it was delicious. I could've easily gone for another round. The dessert was one of the best I've ever had - salted caramel ice cream with popcorn and other delicious mixings.I couldn't have asked for a more perfect birthday dinner with my girlfriends!"
Nathan G.,"Calabasas, CA",10/30/2017,5 star rating,Delicious all around. I ordered the kale salad with seared salmon and it was absolutely delicious. The service is A+ and the setting so nice. Love this restaurant as I often visit when in NYC.
Linda J.,"Noord, Amsterdam, The Netherlands",8/2/2014,5 star rating,"ABC Kitchen is one of our favourite restaurants in NYC.  We've gone many times for both brunch and dinner and every time the experience is the consistent.  We've gone with the just two of us, with friends and also with our parents.  It's a group friendly restaurant where everyone feels comfortable going to.Food: The food is fresh and delicious.  I love the concept of the restaurant where they only serve the freshest and safest ingredients sourced from regional farmers.  We've eaten almost everything on the menu.  The pancakes for breakfast are one of my favourites and the burger is pretty amazing. One thing we always order for brunch is the crab toast - it's a must!Drinks: We always order bellinis when we go. They always have a seasonal one which is always delicious.Price: Its a reasonably priced restaurant for both brunch and dinner.  You would think it's expensive, but you can enjoy this Jean George restaurant and not break the bank.Ambiance:  Not only do they have great food, the space is also beautiful.  It's designed perfectly where it has a casual elegance.  You can go in a suit or shorts and feel comfortable.Service:  I've always had great service when I've gone.  Friendly and helpful.Would I go back?  Absolutely - again and again!"
Hawa A.,"New York, NY",4/11/2017,5 star rating,Literally one of my favorite brunch spots in the city and I brunch very hard! The French toast is the epitome of what French toast should be! The OJ is shockingly fresh! And the decor and ambiance is just so stunning and enjoyable. I love taking people here when I have family and friends visit from out of town. A wonderful experience but a  reservation is a must if you don't want to wait in line because there is typically a line.
Luke S.,"Tustin, CA",5/29/2018,5 star rating,"First of I just have to say wow just wow. The food here is absolutely amazing. This is probably one of the best meals I have eaten. Which is probably to be expected since run by Chef extraordinaire Jean Georges and is a three star Michelin restaurant. I love how everything is organic too! Unfortunately, I can't remember what I had for the life of me but whatever I had I know it was amazing. However, What I do remember is having the pizza and it was good despite not being deep dish pizza. It is a big restaurant but I think it is the perfect size for it. I really liked the vibe too. I bought his book while I was there too. It's a good book! Overall, I really enjoyed the place and would definitely would recommend it. I will come back the next time I'm there."
Carolina D.,"Crows Nest, Australia",4/21/2015,4 star rating,"Despite being a big space, the atmosphere is cosy and inviting. The details such as the cutlery and lighting are cool and the furniture comfortable. Loved all the dishes we tried, particularly the crab toast, beet salad and the sundae dessert, one of the best I've had in New York. Great service too. Will be back again!"
Lesie H.,"Flushing, NY",7/13/2010,4 star rating,"Everyone's been raving about Jean-George's ABC Kitchen, so I decided to see what the talk is about. The restaurant is part of ABC Carpet & Home. You can enter it from the furniture store all the way in the back or at it's official entrance on 18th Street. DECORI went in from the back since my friend insisted and had to walk all the way from the back to the front to be seated in the back again. It was very antique yet modern looking. I can only describe it as... yuppie-hipster. Everything gave you the ambiance of fresh, organic, green, and eco-friendly. It's as if they were completely furnished by ABC Carpet & Home, hmmm..... The plates were definitely from the home store...SERVICEBeside the really grumpy girl that gave my friend an attitude since he was trying to get seated 10 minutes before dinner opening, everyone else was very nice. Courtesy with a smile, very attentive and informative on the menu (I was confused about the difference between market table and appetizers; market table portions are smaller). I felt appreciated. FOOD- Chicken Liver Toast: I never knew how good chicken liver can taste as a spread.- Sugar Snap Pea Salad with Parmesan Dressing and Herbs: Fresh, crispy, healthy, unless you find the cheese too heavy (I don't).- Pretzel Dusted Calamari, Marinara and Mustard Aioli: Tasted like perfected fried calamari at a pub.- Whole Wheat Bigoli, Pork Ragu, Parmesan: I don't get it, but meaty.- Seared Arctic Char with Spicy Corn Broth: Fish is moist and flavorful combined with the corn broth. Skin is crispy. Combination is awesome. Lesie approve!- Salted Caramel Ice Cream Sundae with Candied Peanuts & Popcorn: I never thought I would like salty ice cream, but it works! The caramel flavor is light, so even with the whipped cream and chocolate syrup, it's not as heavy as it sounds! I think I can get used to salty ice cream!- Organic Root Beer: It's green! The root beer flavor is concentrated on the bottom. Floating around is the minty taste. Interesting...- Fizzy Lizzy Raspberry Lemonade: This was the first time I've heard of a Fizzy Lizzy (It's a bottled flavored seltzer/soda). Yummy!DISTRACTIONThere was a solo house fly flying around during the latter part of dinner. It landed on the plate on the table next to me. And then it tried to fly to my table. And then it landed on my friends plate. *shudders*TL;DRFish is yummy! Drinks, Chicken Liver, and Salty ice cream is a good surprise!!! o_O Fly? Fly! Eek!!!"
Jim P.,"Brooklyn, NY",7/26/2010,3 star rating,"Nice place.Clean lines.  Clean Space.  Much better decor than what I remember in it's previous lifetime.How can I rate a diner sometimes 5 stars, and a nice place like this only 3?When, a ""reasonably priced"" glass of wine, after a long Sunday at the office is priced at $14,  and NO WIRELESS.This should be standard in places of this level.  I don't know why businesses don't fully get that yet."
Annie T.,"Brooklyn, NY",9/12/2010,4 star rating,"Oh my.....gorgeous venue!!!! Best example of how simple decor can be stunning.  This whole place feels organic right down to the carbon menu which gives great detail on the back on the source of food. The waiters/waitresses looked so happy to be working there, very jovial, attentive. The sodas, particularly the raspberry, carried great flavor. Ordered the spinach pizza and the main lobster with the corn on the side. The contrast of spinach and cheese was great.  Lobster was good with the vinaigrette but not a favorite (Blue Water Grill still wins).Good portions for the entrees. For dessert, we were recommended the sundae salted caramel-peanut ice cream, which was delicious!! 3 scoops of caramel ice cream sprinkled with pop corn, bathing in hot chocolate sauce. YUM!Place is very large and roomy. I loved how there was adequate spacing between tables. Downside: prices are expensive. Wine glass is freaking $14! Definitely good for special occasions"
Lynette B.,"Miami, FL",5/4/2011,5 star rating,"Crab toast with lemon aioli - Flavorful but not overwhelmingAkaushi cheeseburger- WOW. Simply amazing.  It's one of those things you want to bring all your out-of-towners to try so they can see how great you have it living in this city.  If there's one thing you must have in ABC, it is this burger.We also had a pizza special that included prosciutto, dates and the most amazing cheese among other delicious ingredients.  I wish I'd remembered what they were so I could or maybe beg for them to include it in their regular menu.Excited to go back soon."
Kevin C.,"New York, NY",5/9/2011,4 star rating,"Phenomenal! Love that the concept is all about locally, fresh grown ingredients. Near the kitchen there is a table filled with fresh vegetables that they use in the day's dishes. A friend of mine and fellow yelper Deanna L. commented that the décor is Shabby Sleek. That's the perfect description for this place. The paint is faded and the tables are simple white tabletops unadorned by any fancy linens. However, I heard the tables cost $900 each!Sat next to a group of critics from the James Beard Foundation and watched them dissect and scrutinize the food. It was pretty entertaining.On to the food. We shared the pretzel crusted calamari which was divine. Perfectly crispy on the outside, yet supple on the inside. I had the daily special which was a whole wheat pizza topped by ricotta cheese layered under another type of saltier cheese. Toppings were endives, crispy prosciutto, and California dates. The first few bites were mind blowing. It was SO good, my brain couldn't really comprehend what was going on. My other two friends both agreed that the pizza was in a class of its own. This is perhaps the best pizza I've ever had. I was able to try one of the ricotta veal raviolis. I really enjoyed the homemade pasta outer layer but the filling was pretty standard.I will definitely be back for dinner!"
Laura C.,"Chicago, IL",11/24/2011,4 star rating,"So I was here for Thanksgiving and the food as always amazing.  The hostess..wasn't so friendly.  The enviroment is great, love the decor.  However, the service was slacking big time. I saw so many people walking around not doing anything..acting busy. Our waitress was nice but slow. They forgot 3 of our dessert drinks..we had to remind them twice.  So that was a bit annoying...but besides that it was so yummy!  The stuffing that came along with my turkey plate was soo amazing!"
James C.,"Salt Lake City, UT",2/17/2018,5 star rating,"We ate here in a business trip last week and had one of the best dining experiences ever.  Amazing food, very high quality service and attention to detail.  The food was diverse, unique and just incredible.  I'd highly recommend this place to anyone looking to have an incredible meal."
Lucy W.,"Atlanta, GA",5/5/2013,4 star rating,"French toast for brunch is heavenly...though eating a giant plate of 2"" bread slices dipped in cinnamon sugar put me on a major sugar high...wish they had more entrees that had both salty & sweet (1 egg and 1 piece of French toast would have done the trick).  Blood orange mimosa/bellini was tasty and pretty to look at.I was amongst a crowd of people knocking at the door waiting for the restaurant to open...definitely make reservations well in advance, glad I did.  The storefront is pretty non-descript from the outside...if it wasn't for the crowd of people out front, I wouldn't know this was a restaurant space.Love the decor- whoever is the buyer for ABC Home and the decorator for ABC Kitchen needs to come decorate my condo, because it's absolutely gorgeous."
Lindsey W.,"Hackensack, NJ",7/28/2015,4 star rating,"This place was great! The atmosphere was nice. White tables with beige place settings, some mismatched floral plates and exposed brick walls. Waitresses and bartenders were dressed in flannels and has their hair in top knot buns, which looked clean and casual. We came here between meetings in the city and was served quickly, which is exactly what we needed! I ordered a goat cheese and arugula pizza and my boss ordered an onion and prosciutto pizza and we split the pies. They were about 10"" and could probably pass as a personal pie for a guy. Girls could probably get two pies and share.  The only thing I didn't like was the water/soda glasses were a little small and filled with ice. Maybe a little more drink and a little less ice or a bigger glass."
Onion N.,"Savannah, GA",3/15/2017,3 star rating,"Would give it five for the amazing atmosphere alone. My issue may have been specific to my situation, but the dishes I had (while good and interesting) felt like missed opportunities to give me something amazing-which makes me cranky in retrospect. Three stars because the mushroom bolognese came out looking like a portioned bag of dry microwaved pasta (with a GREAT sauce poured on top.) The hot sauce butter served with both the mushroom app and my entree of fried chicken was DELICIOUS... but why not serve the mushrooms along with the chicken instead of having both? Or put that fried chicken with a little more starch? The apple pie came out barely warm. Mainly, everything was good, but for the price I feel like more care could have been given to each dish- more so the process of cooking than the actual menu. It felt next level, but even I felt like I could have brought my food in the back and made it even better (and I don't claim to be a chef) I will say the cranberry compote with homemade ricotta was cool!"
Ceres R.,"New York, NY",7/15/2014,2 star rating,"Extremely disappointing.  Came in with high hopes, since I LOVE Jean-Georges, but this place is not really comparable in any respect.  Granted, it has only one Michelin star, but that usually means something (for instance, Gramercy Tavern located nearby is head and shoulders above this place).  The service was indifferent, and felt almost rushed.  The food was also, unfortunately, indifferent at best.    I have to say that the kale salad, which came highly recommended, was the biggest  let-down.  3 of us ordered the kale salad, and none of us even bothered to finish it.  It's just a huge portion of really bland kale, with some Serrano chilies sprinkled on top.  There were no discernible lemony or minty flavors whatsoever.  The crab toast with lemon aioli was OK--it's a big portion but the crab salad on the toast was just generic crab salad.  The diver scallops were decent, and probably the only thing reminiscent of eating at Jean-Georges.   The best things we had were the salted caramel and popcorn sundae for dessert, and the lattes to finish our meal.  Given that our lunch bill for four people was around $300, I see no reason to return, especially when there are far better fine dining options in Midtown and Union Square."
Virginia G.,"Manhattan, NY",8/18/2019,4 star rating,"Best way to try this top notch place is at lunchtime when you are more likely to get a reservation or a seat at the bar as a walk in plus the price fixe menu is always good (3 choices of starter,entree &dessert). The wait staff is terrific, even graciously accommodating those who want to share large portions. The salted caramel sundae is worth all the calories. I only withheld a star because of the noise level. Hard to have a conversation"
Patricia L.,"Brooklyn, NY",4/18/2015,5 star rating,"Spectacular. Everything we had was delicious. Vegetables were only seasonal and very fresh. The brussel sprouts were from out of this world and the pizza was magnificent. The fish was great too. Really for the quality of what you get is not expensive. And the atmosphere was great! Oh, and please, order one bloody Mary. It was v good too!I now want to try their brunch. I've been told it's one not to be missed."
Colette F.,"Maplewood, NJ",12/16/2015,4 star rating,"Great food and such a fun atmosphere! Came here with a group of 8 and we had a perfect round corner table. The tuna sashimi appetizer and hake entree were delicious, and the sundae with salted caramel ice cream and popcorn is a must for any dessert lover! Also tried the crab toast (ok) and pretzel-covered calamari (great). Some of my party thought the lobster was a little spicy but I thought it looked good."
Marsha N.,"Cromwell, CT",5/2/2015,4 star rating,"We chose ABC Kitchen by searching nearby places that rated well on Yelp. It was freezing out and we were using Google maps to help us find the place. It is in the middle of the street and the sign is small and gray. This made it a little tricky to find. From the front it looks small but once inside you see how far back and wide it becomes. There's a bar along the right wall in the front, high top tables and then more normal dining sitting along the back. In the far back there's another bar that seats about 6 people. We sat at the bar in the front in hopes that a table would open or another bar chair would become available. They only allow you to order food if you have a proper seat/space at the bar. This doesn't include the service-drink-well on the side. My bartender friend expressed how annoying it is when patrons camp out at the service-well. The bartenders were friendly and answered our many questions about what cheeses and meats were in their cheese & meat appetizer."
Melody C.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",4/12/2018,3 star rating,Not bad but not great. The decor is very inviting and homey even though the food is at a much less homey and more sophisticated level. And they have no respect for customers.
Esther C.,"GA, GA",11/4/2012,4 star rating,"Came here for my birthday for dinner service a couple of weeks ago. Huge fan of Jean-Georges, I especially liked that this location sources organic, local ingredients.  Food was pretty solid, I ordered in this order: Chicken Liver Toast - Pretty good for what it is .. This was my first time trying chicken liver.. all I have to say is Chicken Liver is Chicken Liver... not sure how creative you can get with it , but it was good enough for me.Housemade ricotta, fig compote and grilled bread- DELICIOUS! Not sure that they offer it anymore, checked back and saw that they replaced fig with strawberry. I'm sure it is still killerFish and chips - Was light and tasty for being friedroast suckling pig - First impression was that it is a small serving, but realized how heavy the dish is in the first bite. Was very delicious.Red wine poached pear over hazlenut spread and hazlenut ice cream - Pretty solid, nothing to write home about. While the food was solid, plating/presentation was a little bit shabby for a Jean-Georges restaurant. The atmosphere definitely gets 5 stars, I love the rustic feeling of this place... reminds me of anthropologie (which, conveniently enough, is right next door). While the decor of ABC kitchen is great, the servers were a bit cold and not exactly friendly. Make sure to make a reservation, otherwise, you should be expecting a 45 min to 1.5 hour wait."
Jessica M.,"Los Angeles, CA",10/19/2016,5 star rating,"God I love this whole group of restaurants. Came here just because with two girlfriends to ""spill tea"" over drinks and great food. Everything was amazing omg. Make sure to get the Thyme Lemonade - it's amazing. Also spinach pizza is slamming. Oh and that burger! My goodness. Everything is perfect here."
Kippy P.,"Lutherville, MD",6/27/2012,5 star rating,"Brunch is AMAZING! Our waiter was awesome! He was energetic and so knowledgeable! He made amazing suggestions. Per his suggestion I got the Wine Cooler to drink- so good! I think it had rhubarb and basil in it and they put it in a cute little bottle. They also have a great beer and wine selection and a ton of amazing drinks to chose from! We started with the bacon biscuits- OMG can you say bacon baked into a biscuit- so melt in your mouth good! Our waiter recommended the french toast to me- I am such a huge french toast person and I am so glad he did! It is soaked in the batter for I think he said 10 or 20 hours and then fried to perfection with amazing cherries on the side- it was AMAZING!My hubby got the mushroom and egg pizza, which was fantastic! Everyone was so friendly and the service was fantastic! One of the best brunch experiences ever! We will definitely be back next time we are in the city!"
Supriya M.,"Mountain View, CA",3/20/2017,4 star rating,Made reservations three weeks in advance for a saturday night table..Really good ambience..ok service... limited options for a vegetarian for mains.. Everything vegetarian we had was really good :) Hoping they expand their veg menu...definetly going back for everything we ate! Ravioli and the ricotta cranberry compote and the creme brule and the chocolate cake :):):):)
Tracy W.,"New York, NY",2/4/2018,5 star rating,"I've been wanting to try this place for ages. Did not disappoint. We started with crab toast (fresh and light) and butternut squash soup. For entree we ordered pork confit w/ bacon marmalade (soooo good) and the fried chicken (amazing, juicy, crispy). Already full, but could not pass on dessert. Got the almond cake (delicious). Service was also wonderful. Servers knew their stuff, described the food well and checked in without being pushy.Can't wait to come back!"
Lauren A.,"Halifax, Canada",8/27/2015,5 star rating,This is one of the prettiest restaurants I've been in.  The service and food are top notch. I would love to eat every meal of the day here. Highly highly recommend it. Best burger I've ever had. Fantastic pizzas. Delightful drinks and desserts.  Love it all!!
JJ O.,"Kansas City, MO",7/14/2019,5 star rating,Don't let the exterior construction scare you off. Walking though the doors to a great oasis. Check in early and enjoy a relaxing drink at the bar. The bartender makes some unique cocktails. The dining room is like you stepped into a Paris restaurant. The food and waitstaff do not disappoint! Treat yourself to ABC.
Marco M.,"Manhattan, NY",8/13/2014,4 star rating,"My second time around was just as good here. The food still knocked it out of the park, but I had to unfortunately drop it a star because of a sub par service performance comparative to last time.  Overall, a great time and some interesting background music too :)For apps, we did the beets with yogurt, homemade ricotta with strawberry compote, pretzel dusted calamari and crab toast aioli.  All of them were excellent but stick with the ricotta and lemon crab aioli as they were the winners here in my opinion on taste and freshness.  Entrees, I can vouch for the snapper in a lemon soup base and the crunchy pork confit (out of sight!). First time around I did the rabbit and this time was the pork with cherry bacon marmalade, OMG!  Must. Get. It. Desserts, only thing noteworthy is what I am sure you continually see pictures or read about and that's the Sundae.  It's large and in charge enough for a party of 4 to get a healthy serving each.  It's still crazy to have all those flavors and texture elements in this one dessert, but it's hands down the way to finish the meal here.  Buon appetito!"
Cat S.,"Manhattan, NY",7/11/2014,3 star rating,"Finally got to try ABC Kitchen, and don't get me wrong, the food was good, but I definitely don't think it's worth all the hype and the long wait (like making a reservation 2 months ahead for eating dinner at 5 PM). To start, I was shocked by how huge this place was. Because of insanely limited reservation availability, I just assumed this was a tiny restaurant. Nope, it's humongous. No restaurant this big should have this long of a lead time for dining here. I seriously question the efficiency here. And if they're withholding reservations to create an air of exclusivity, well f you. Disclaimer, I'm a vegetarian. So perhaps the meat/seafood dishes would be more impressive here. We shared a few things:- The roasted carrot and avocado salad was by far my favorite part of the meal, it was incredible as far as salads go.- The kale salad PALED in comparison. Very boring and bland.- The mushroom and parm pizza with eggs was really good, but very rich. I couldn't get more than a slice down because it was sitting so heavy in my stomach. - House fries were predictably good.- Carrot cake for dessert was pretty bad. Not interesting or impressive at all. This time we lucked out and got a last minute reservation for Friday dinner at 8 PM (weren't seated until 8:20, btw), but I don't think this place is worth having to have dinner at 5 PM or 10:30 PM, ever. P.S. Don't waste your money on a cocktail here."
Sara B.,"Boston, MA",12/5/2015,4 star rating,"Had a great experience here on a Thursday night. Walked in with a friend so we had an hour wait but had a tasty drink while we did - the Manhattan is perfect. For an appetizer I tried the tuna sashimi and it's the best I've had in NYC because of the ginger soy sauce. My only complaint was that it was a little too small a portion. The hake entree was excellent. It came with crispy potatoes and a sauce I'm still dreaming about. the sundae for dessert was amazing, although I could have done without the popcorn on top. We sat in the back room where the restaurant meets ABC Cocina and it was a great ambiance - had privacy but felt communal. I think we had chatted with half the dining room by the time our dinner was over. Highly recommend, especially because the service was also outstanding."
Anvy A.,"Manhattan, NY",5/10/2012,2 star rating,"Came back for a third time and was really disappointed. Just didn't order the right things, I guess.I started off with the chicken liver toast. I absolutely love pate, but I really didn't like the tangy vinegar in this dish.I also tried the famous mushroom and farm egg pizza, and it was terrible. The whites of the egg were still raw and runny, and the pizza soaked it all up and became incredibly soggy. The mushroom flavor was overwhelming, and it was just too difficult to eat this pizza.I actually only ate 1/4 of my meal and looked longingly at my friend's french toast (which is to die for).Next time, I'm sticking to the french toast, eggs benny or smoked salmon (my fav). The crab toast is way better than the chicken liver toast. The calamari is also good but not rock-my-world good."
J S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",8/11/2019,3 star rating,Went there on a Saturday night expecting nice crowd and good food as not first time I have been there.  Was very surprised at the crowd which I found to be both loud and for the most part inconsiderate of other patrons.   The food was very good although the mushroom pizza which is a staple was very salty.  The staff although nice was young and inexperienced which also surprised me.  While the food prices were expensive but not unreasonable the prices they charge for some of the alcohol was absurd.  I like to have a scotch before or after my meal depending on my mood and it was $26 for a Lagavulin 16 and $19 for a Balvenie 12 which are very very high.  On principal I just had a $13 beer with my dinner.  The salmon diner was the highlight the food was very good just ambiance very disappointing maybe just cause it was a Saturday night in August
Eileen C.,"Philadelphia, PA",7/28/2014,3 star rating,"Came here for a family birthday brunch at 2pm on a Sunday. The space is beautiful and our table was nice and spacious! It took a while for us to get service, both for preliminary drinks and for food, but when our server was around he was very friendly and offered great recommendations to my family members. My reasons for knocking a few stars is that i (annoyingly) have celiac disease and so need to be extra careful about my gluten allergy. The server didn't seem to know whic items were gluten free (which is fine, it can be a lot to remember!) so I asked him to check on a few things before ordering. Then these things I asked him to check on simply came out with the rest of our food. When i asked a runner if an item was gluten free he said ""ummmmm yes?"" i asked ""are you sure"" and he said ""no. I can check."" I ended up being too nervous about whether or not my food was safe for me to eat to actually eat much/enjoy eating here. However, my other family members absolutely loved it. Moral : if you have allergens, maybe not the best place to go. If not, this place seems delicious!"
Kara R.,"Cardiff-by-the-Sea, CA",12/12/2014,5 star rating,"I wish I could give 6 stars. We couldn't get reservations but when we called, the hostess told us to come in anyway and wait for a high top table in the bar. We only had a 20 minute wait and snagged a great table. It's a gorgeous spot - decor is well done. We knew we picked the right spot when I bit into the crab toast - it's scrumptious and decadent!  Calamari is so good! A must. Kale salad was better than any kale salad I have tried - and I live in California!!My man got the lobster and he was in heaven - I had the ravioli We gave up our reservation at Babbo to try this place. I'm so glad we did - what a great time!"
Heather C.,"Sammamish, WA",7/7/2017,3 star rating,"I came here for Sunday brunch and I had an okay experience. The atmosphere is really nice, beautiful decor and lighting. I ordered the pancakes with lemon curd and berries and they were good but not amazing. For $18 pancakes I expected them to be at least above average. My brother ordered the eggs benedict which was also decent but nothing to rave about. If you're looking for a cute restaurant to take pictures at this is the place to go. But if you want fantastic brunch food, this is not it."
Joanna D.,"Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY",10/3/2015,5 star rating,Excellent interior design. Superior service. Food...not as excellent. 5 stars for design and everything else4 stars for food
Alden W.,"New York, NY",9/14/2010,5 star rating,"Sustainable, local, organic food. Beautiful, eco-friendly decor. Friendly and efficient service. A celebrity sighting. This restaurant has everything I could possibly want!Flip over the menu and you'll find extensive detail on all of their sustainable creds, including local artisan-made table and dishes, vintage tea cups and dessert plates, humanely-raised meat sources, etc, etc. This is the stuff that every restaurant should have!I don't want to use the word delicious too often, so I'll just list all the things we ordered, and you can assume it all falls under that category (this was a couple nights ago, so my memory is a bit fuzzy. Approximations follow):Mixed drinks, peekytoe crab toast, lobster, lamb chops, house-made bow tie pasta with veal meatballs, salad over roasted carrots, mixed drinks, organic beer, arctic char, salted caramel sundae, donuts with bacon fudge sauce (a controversial choice, yes) strawberries with juice and floating meringue puffs, and carrot cake. You owe it to yourself to try this restaurant!"
Jared L.,"Pine Brook, NJ",8/15/2015,5 star rating,"Enjoyed a fantastic and memorable dinner with my girlfriend and her family. The ambience, food, cocktails, wine and service combined for a tremendous eveningAmbience: really enjoyed the laid back and casual atmosphere that included the wait staff donning plaid shirts and the diners dressing ""smart casual.""  The restaurant is decorated like its namesake - the abc furniture store - with both minimalist and contemporary leanings. It's a big space with a fair number of tables squeezed tightly together but the noise level or space were never issues. Food: we couldn't say enough good things about the food. I'd recommend ordering several small plates and appetizers to share and then ordering individual entrees that are healthily portioned but can be finished. The highlights included the mushroom pizza, heirloom tomato toast, tuna sashimi, and the carrot and avocado salad. The fish and vegetables were incredibly fresh and also excitingly seasoned and the mushroom pizza is a cant miss for the excellent combo of the mushrooms and Parmesan cheese. I ordered the fried chicken as my entree and could not have been happier. The portion is very generous - it's a half chicken that is deboned and perfectly fried and crispy. The chicken is flavorful alone but the spicy butter sauce is an amazing add to an already great centerpiece. The desserts were also excellent with the can't miss dessert being the caramel popcorn sundae. Drink: we all agreed that the cocktails were top notch and the wine list is smartly organized by type and flavor instead of the traditional region ordering. Service: the waitress was very knowledgeable about the food and offered smart suggestions for both food and drink. The food was brought out at perfect intervals and the service never felt intrusive nor rushed. Overall: we all agreed that we would soon be visiting abc lichen again"
Cynthia S.,"San Francisco, CA",7/14/2014,5 star rating,"One of my favorite restaurants in NYC. It is one of those places that really has the full package - amazing food, friendly service, and a nice ambiance. I don't know whether it is the decor or the actual size of the space, but the restaurant feels really large, which i appreciate given that so many dining options in Manhattan force you to squeeze close to other parties and listen in on each others' conversations. My bf and I came here for brunch and split the roasted carrot and avocado salad, tomato/basil/buffalo pizza, akaushi cheeseburger, and seasonal glazed doughnuts (a brunch item that we ordered for dessert). Everything was cooked to perfection and the carrots in my salad were hands down the best carrots I have ever tasted! I also particularly loved the cheeseburger - the quality of the ingredients used and preparation were especially evident here. I would love to come back here and sample some more items. I highly recommend the method of splitting several plates - 4 was perfect for a pretty hungry pair.A tip: you'll want to make a reservation about a month out for this restaurant for a weekend brunch."
Liza D.,"New York, NY",9/19/2014,5 star rating,"So, your parents are visiting you in NYC in 2 weeks and instruct you to make brunch, lunch or dinner reservations... what do you do? Immediately go to Opentable and make a reservation at ABC Kitchen. Why it's worth it: This restaurant is located at the ABC Carpet & Home department store, which means you can browse trendy chandeliers and other items before heading to the bar...but back to the restaurant, this is how I would like to eat at my fancy country house, if I had a fancy country house.Vibe/layout: The vibe is organic and Hamptons, airy, open and relaxed. The theme is sustainability, as most things on the menu come from local suppliers; the menus are made from recycled paper, the dun-colored place mats are compostable and after closing time, all leftovers are sent off to the compost heap. Everything, including the antique armoires, reclaimed-wood tables, clay dishware, chandeliers and wildflower table settings are gathered from local artisans in CT, NY and NJ.Ideal meal: House made ricotta ravioli, herbs and tomato sauce ($15) or akaushi cheeseburger ($24)F.Y.I.: We recommend making reservations 10 days in advance, as this is a Jean-George Vongerichten restaurant.For the artsy restaurant goers: Among the local artists and artisans who contributed to this restaurant's decor are Jan Burtz (handmade porcelain plates), Jim Denney (recycle-wood tables), Eric Slayton (steel and concrete art installations) and Elena Lyakir (abstract nature photography)."
Monica J.,"New York, NY",11/18/2015,3 star rating,Environment is good and nice but food is just okay for me. Too much oil for the crab toast and the pasta.
Chek S.,"New York, NY",1/16/2016,5 star rating,This place is Amazing!!! Came here for my 30th bday ! Please try their crab toast !! It's to die for ! Yum !! Thinking about it makes me hungry!! Oh!! Their drinks are off the charts ! Love love love this place !
Shane M.,"Capistrano Beach, CA",11/15/2017,2 star rating,"I came to ABC kitchen with high hopes as my sister has talked about going here for months. The best thing about ABC is the decor, The bar mirror and overall style and ambience of the place is great. However, the food was not exciting in the least. I ordered the burger while everyone else got fish entrees, the burger was not that tasty but a decent size but the fish entrees were extremely small and disappointing in flavor as well. Definitely not worth the $200+ bill and still being hungry when we left especially considering the many other options nearby."
King K.,"New York, NY",9/17/2017,4 star rating,"One of the better chicken dishes I've ever had in NYC. The sundae was also incredible. It's tough for a place to stay on the NYC dining scene for long, but ABC Kitchen has managed to do so. Longevity is probably the toughest part of the New York City dining scene, but ABC Kitchen has managed to stay on track."
Harika C.,"Seattle, WA",6/21/2015,5 star rating,"Absolutely love the food at ABC Kitchen! I rave about this place to all my friends.  Came here on a date without reservations and we were seated in 30 minutes by the small round tables across from the bar.  The aesthetic of the restaurant (by the bar and where the dinner tables are set) was beautiful.  The service was great but this is no surprise since it's a Danny Meyer restaurant.  We ordered a bunch of tapas which was some of the best food I have ever tasted.  We had the mushroom toast, roast carrot and avocado salad, tomatoes flatbread, and the roasted butternut.  The roasted butternut was the best plate of food that I have ever tasted in NYC!  The drinks were also creative and tasty.  This place is definitely worth the price tag!   Great place for a date, dinner with friends or family."
Mikey K.,"Manhattan, NY",4/29/2013,5 star rating,"Went here for lunch today and everything on the menu sounded amazing.  My entire group of four got the pre-fix lunch though.With my pre-fix lunch I had the green pea soup with carrots, the salmon, and salted carmel ice cream with candied peanuts.The entire meal was really tasty.  I liked the fact that everything was fresh, organic, and local.  The space was very intimate too.  I also had the basil and lime soda.  The soda was amazzzzzing.Kind of pricey, but then again this is NYC.  Also the portions were a tad small, but it's suppose to be lunch.  And maybe I'm just a fatty, 'cause I would have had a second helping of each.  I need to remember portion control for myself and be honest about the portions being small.  They were actually decent for lunch.  By the way, the dessertThe host and the servers were all very friendly and upbeat with a smile on their face while also being professional.It also appears they change the mood for dinner.  Brining out candles for the table, making two tables into one, etc.  They basically shut down.  We were there towards the end.  It would have been nice if they waited till we left, but it didn't bother us that much.  Plus we got candles on our table while we fished our dessert.Our server also left, but he was one of those servers who lets you know he's leaving and says ""Nathan will be handling your table for the rest of your meal.""  Which I thought was cool so we're not like left waiting or who are you when the new server appears.I would definitely bring out of town guest here or just a buddy so they experience Jean Georges vision of food.Love!"
Tanya A.,"Los Angeles, CA",7/30/2017,3 star rating,"The food is good, the decor and space is lovely, but geeez Louise the service is sooooooooooooo slowweww! It took forever for us to order. Our server was no where to be found during our visit. Even to pay it took forever. I always found myself looking around for our guy."
Jen G.,"Clifton, NJ",1/9/2016,4 star rating,Ahhh I really want to give this place 5 stars because the roasted hake main course was one of the best dishes I ever had. It was beautiful and delicious! The dessert donuts were a letdown. So just don't get the donuts and you will love the place.
Saya N.,"New York, NY",9/26/2014,5 star rating,"By far my favorite restaurant in the city. Been here many times but my first review. Ambiance - busy but classy, louder towards the front area where the bar is located. Service is always outstanding.We ordered the cavatelli, the fried chicken (omg so good), the hake, the mashed potatoes and five too many ginger margaritas. The mashed potatoes are so good that one time I came here alone and sat at the bar and ate an entire bowl alone, by myself, with my head down in fear that someone I know would see me. So good. The ginger margarita is out of this world also. The worst part about this place is getting a reservation. It's not easy but the effort is well worth it."
Doris L.,"Toronto, Canada",3/26/2013,4 star rating,"Went there on a rainy Passover monday for a late lunch with a girlfriend.Both of us ordered the set lunch  that  started off with the butternut squash soup. It was delicious! It's not your typical thick hearty soup. Light, not too sweet, was it truffle oil or something else that made it more savory? It was just plain salt, it had a bit of complexity to it.  Perfect soup for a wet and cold afternoon.Next,  I had the crispy skate salad. The portion was overwhelming for me. It was good. I wish it wasn't so heavy on the tartar sauce and they gave it a bit more of a tang to it. Maybe vinaigrette on the side? We noticed the ladies beside us ordered a la carte and every dish of theirs seemed smaller than ours, but perhaps they ordered small plates, sides and not main course. My friend enjoyed her ravioli, she devoured that but left the ragout meat since it was filling. We both had the sundae to finish off. We thought we were full, but when we started having the salted caramel popcorn sundae with fudge and all .... we were in heaven. Initially we thought one scoop of ice cream is sufficient, but we devoured the two that came with it. It was that good. I spent the next 2 hours trying to walk off just the fudge. Going out of order here... basil lime daiquiri was nothing to write home about. It was way too sweet even though it was really strong. We almost wanted to ask for that in a Bellini format instead. Service was good. I didn't like the fact there were a few of us at the bar with 2pm reservations and they kept us at the bar for a while when clearly there were tables in the back with place settings ready for patrons. It was silly. Really cute atmosphere, great little flower arrangements everywhere, yet the place is lively. Hope I will return soon!"
Nicole B.,"New York, NY",12/14/2016,3 star rating,"The first time I can here was for lunch and it was definitely a 4/5 star experience. The last time I came was for dinner and a lot of the dishes left me disappointed. The one standout was definitely the crab toast, believe the hype!"
N C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",7/29/2019,1 star rating,Very long wait for food. It was monday lunch on restaurant week. Main course still not served after 1.5hours. Food is good but not worth the wait.
A. J.,"New York, NY",7/17/2011,5 star rating,"I highly recommend coming here for brunch -- but make a reservation days in advance. This place gets packed on Saturday/Sunday. Service is great though and you are taken care of from the moment you walk in the door. As for the food, start with the crab toast. It's delicious and a good app to start the meal off right.  Seriously, you won't regret it! I had the smoked salmon (which was perfect and light). My boyfriend had the jalapeno burger. I had a bite and it melted in my mouth. Seriously, the Spotted Pig needs to move over. There is a better burger in town -- and this is it! Yum!"
William M.,"Los Angeles, CA",8/18/2012,5 star rating,Had lunch here today. Started with the squash salad with parmesan and herb dressing. Really good. Then we split the spinach pizza. Good but not great.Update July 2014:  been here several times now for dinner. Food is awesome - never had a disappointing dish - ever!   Try the mushroom pizza - soooo good.
Ken H.,"Manhattan, NY",11/14/2012,3 star rating,"Total: 3.5 ABC Kitchen, one of Jean Georges establishments closed to Union Square. First of all, I love the decor. Wooden floors and dining sets are simple and casual in a sense but still sophisticated or upscale. The food was delicious but not very impressive except that everything on the menu is organic and comes from local farms. Affordable price is attractive.Food:3.5 Every dish using local ingredients was very simple but great. If you expect a exciting dish, this is not a place...My favorite dishes 9/26 Melon and Watermelon Salad Roast Suckling PigService: 3.0 The service was solid throughout but not a highlight of the restaurant.Decor: 4.0 The best part of a restaurant was decor without question.(Take a look at pictures!) I amazed a flower shop in the restaurant, absolutely beautiful! And that was nicely coordinated with the white wooden interior. Definitely great for a date or special occasion."
Rebecca M.,"Theater District, Manhattan, NY",4/30/2019,3 star rating,"Just mediocre. The calamari was nice, along w the tuna app. But unfortunately the kohlrabi was cut to large within the avacado feta salad making it unappealing. The pizza was also too crispy for our liking but still good flavor. Not worth the hype or the price."
A C.,"North Haven, CT",11/26/2014,4 star rating,A great place to pop in and have a nibble at the bar.  It's a Jean Georges resto so it gets packed and the wait can be substantial so make sure you plan in advance.  It's very pretty inside and the staff is all adorable and lovely.  You'll have a great time.
Eliot S.,"Rye, NY",10/31/2015,5 star rating,"My girlfriend and I went here impromptu today for Brunch. From start to go, they did a perfect job. On Halloween Brunch, we were sit immediately. The bartenders were just chatty enough to learb Im an industry guy, and they went out of the way to show some industry love.As a guy who only gets maybe a day off a week it makes a big difference to what those free hours mean. I got more then I had ever expected walking in. The staff was warm, John the bartender really was a great guy, and absolutely on point with service. The manager was also an incredibly nice lady.The food was spectacular. The eggs with fried oysters really were special, and my GF got the french toast, which was delictable and very filling.Anyway, I highly reccomend a visit and Ill be becoming a regular."
Wendy H.,"Phoenix, AZ",5/6/2017,5 star rating,This is one of my favorite restaurants to visit time and time again. I usually get the lunch prix fixe. Each time I order something different and am never disappointed. The flavors are complex and fresh. The seasonal soups are always delightfully different.
Sandy Y.,"Auburndale, Queens, NY",6/12/2014,5 star rating,"My first impression of this place was wow, its like a cute little garden in here. I love that they cook with fresh organic ingredients. The service was superb and the food was just as good as it looked. The egg and mushroom pizza was super rich but super yummy. And the crunchy shrimp salad with carrot sesame dressing is a dish that will keep me coming back. The shrimp could be ""crunchier"" though. They also have an extensive drinks menu. Fantastic girls lunch date spot."
Becky C.,"San Francisco, CA",11/18/2014,3 star rating,"I wanted to give this place a try as it's highly rated on Yelp and the food looked good. The pros: The restaurant decor and ambiance is lovely. Very beautiful and delicate looking decor. The presentation of the food was also great, made the food look scrumptious. I enjoyed by ahi tuna and desserts thoroughly. The cons: My friend and I had chosen the prix fixed menu with appetizers, entrees and desserts. He had the soup and fish dish (sorry, forgot the names - refer to photo), which ended up being nearly the same thing. The soup was almost like a liquid version of his entree and didn't stand out. My dish was some kind of pasta I believe and it was just so salty and not enjoyable."
Ariel P.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",3/30/2018,4 star rating,The decor is very inviting and homey even though the food is at a much less homey and more sophisticated level. The service was very attentive and nothing was too much trouble.
Elaine P.,"Alpharetta, GA",12/28/2016,1 star rating,"This review is not about the food at all, but a story about employee behavior, which I think the establishment should know about. Around 2 in the afternoon yesterday, my husband and I were strolling around the neighborhood, looking up restaurants through Yelp. This one showed up, so gave it a try. When we walked in and asked for a table for 2 but didn't have reservations, the 3 girls that were in charge got all a flutter and said we might need to wait up to 1 1/2 hour at the bar for them to possibly fit us in. They recommended that we go to a sister restaurant in ABC (and called them) to tell us that the wait there was 28 minutes. So we decided to forgo either restaurant, but decided to walk through the restaurant to go into the ABC store. When we walked through, more than half the (huge) restaurant was unoccupied! Needless to say we were totally bewildered about that interaction and behavior of those fluttery girls. We felt discriminated against, but that could hardly be the case, because we are somewhat generic New Yorkers (if that can be generic!). So what's up ABC Kitchen????? Since we were on the go, and a bit put off, we moved on. However, if I had read deeper into the great reviews about the food on Yelp, I would have walked all the way back through the restaurant and been a bit more insistent to have our lunch there. We ended up having our lunch up the street at Craft, which was fine."
Ana M.,"San Francisco, CA",4/6/2017,5 star rating,"Such tasty, high quality, fresh food. A refreshing spot in NYC that feels light yet filling, healthy yet delicious. I tried the chicken liver toast, the beets with homemade yogurt, the roasted carrot avocado salad, the hake, and the apple pie, and all were to die for. Highly recommend!"
Wo w.,"Chicago, IL",12/16/2017,3 star rating,The freshness of this place is great when it works. Other times though the supply chain seems to be short and the menu requires more of a stretch of the imagination to create and to enjoy. Excellent service though. Attentive and cooperative wait staff!
William M.,"New York, NY",12/17/2015,5 star rating,"My favorite restaurant in NYC! I have been here about 5-6 times and it never disappoints. Two items I get each and every time are:- kabocha squash toast- roast carrot and avocado saladI know its a salad, but its the best damn salad I have ever had. I seriously hate carrots too. Anyway, you really cannot go wrong on anything here and a definite great place to take the parents, girlfriends, or grab lunch with a client. Its a must try in NYC!"
Eunice C.,"Toronto, Canada",5/24/2017,3 star rating,"The venue is huge and has a rustic-chic french vibe to the interior. Dimly lit so you can't really take great photos of your food, BUT, service was great. I had the french toast and the eggs benedict with a friend and it was just okay. Nothing out of this world, just okay. Price is very steep since it's all organic. Small portions."
Jennifer M.,"San Marino, CA",11/9/2014,4 star rating,"Super beautiful decor and ambience! We arrived without reservation for Sunday lunch at 11:05am and were seated promptly. Within 5 minutes the place was packed.Food:Crab toast- nice chunks of crab meat excellent flavorTuna sashimi- the citrus sauce was really nice and uplifted the cut of tuna, which was mediocre. Sea bass- surprising and subtle slivers of jalapeño combined with perfectly cooked , super fresh bass Scrambled eggs and oysters- great combination of flavor and texture but UBER rich, 1-2 bites was very filling. Recommend ordering to share because the richness can get overwhelming.Great service!"
Karnchana S.,"Brooklyn, NY",12/10/2017,4 star rating,Came here for dinner with my friends.  Staffs was friendly  and food was good. Great spot to hangout with friends for drinks and small bite with great service
Anny C.,"San Jose, CA",1/24/2013,3 star rating,"3 stars because I was dissatisfied with the cleanliness and the service of the place. My friend recommended this place for me to try. She told me it was really nice and that the food is great. She was right about the food. I had the eggs benedict and it was amazing! The eggs were poached perfectly. The english muffin was not overcooked.I also ordered the calamai for an appetizer and it was okay. It tastes like any other places' calamari. When I was eating the calamari with my fork, I felt a rough texture on my fork. I took the fork out of my mouth and realized that it had dried lettuce stuck on it! I notified one of the servers and he looked unapologetic. When he apologized it was NOT sincere. I couldn't believe a restaurant like that would have that type of service.Overall, I really enjoyed my meal, but was not content with the service."
Lili K.,"Manhattan, NY",11/19/2014,3 star rating,"This place is absolutely gorgeous inside!  I loved how it looked-soo pretty!  I must've passed by this spot a million times and never noticed it, since it's pretty unassuming from the outside.Anyways-our party of 4 came here for dinner, and I had their fettuccine, appetizer size (funny how it's an appetizer or dinner portion, though I loved that-the appetizer portion is definitely a good size amount for one person, fyi!).  Anyways, the pasta I thought was pretty flavorless and limp-blah -_-The brussels sprouts, garlic, jalapenos and lemon pizza was a lot better, though!  I loved the spice the jalapenos put to it!!As for dessert, we got the popular salted caramel ice cream with popcorn-it was pretty good, but that portion seemed bigger than our appetizer entree, so I definitely recommend sharing it with your group."
Amy M.,"Manhattan, NY",2/7/2018,4 star rating,Very good meal and amazing service. My only complaint is that the menu selection was limited - but I also understand the concept that the food should show quality over quantity of choices. The tuna sashimi and crab toast appetizers were fantastic. The sea bass entree and the braised brussell sprout pistachio pesto fettucine entree were sublime. Good portions! Great ambience! We had a lovely waitress who appreciated and respected us as customers which made it a special night. Highly reccommended!!!
Tyler S.,"New York, NY",3/26/2014,5 star rating,Love ABC Kitchen. Everything about it. From the food to the decorations.Super accommodating to altering dishes to suit your needs. Fave dish is definitely the cauliflower with the egg on top! (always order at least 2 orders!)And for desert the sundae (which contains caramel popcorn)
Ziwei Echo R.,"Manhattan, NY",1/31/2017,5 star rating,Great ambiance and service! Healthy options available!
Valerie M.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",9/18/2014,4 star rating,"Believe the hype.In a city with endless dining options, it can be extremely difficult to navigate. Luckily we have yelp and the unrelenting need to feed (pun intended) our curiosity. Now in between pizza binge sessions, we found a pocket of time to check out these digs. A quick cab ride from our hotel (Gansevoort Park Ave - review coming soon) and we were transported into what felt like a scene out of SATC : bustling, dim, gorgeous ""I just left the office but I'm wearing my fabulous transitional day-to-night outfit"" groups of women, suits, artsy types, and just the right amount of pretention. I just wish it was a tad bit brighter so we could appreciate the organic yet extravagant interior.Now the food. Ambitious, delicious, AND decently priced. You can't go wrong with the kale salad or fried chicken. And you must try the salted caramel and popcorn dessert death trap. Don't forget the extensive and innovative cocktail menu - probably the reason I can't remember anything past the 1st course. We will be back!"
beverly c.,"New York, NY",4/20/2014,2 star rating,"I'm writing this review now, a year later, because I just remembered the anniversary of my food poisoning from this restaurant. I hope they have improved their cleanliness because 3 of my friends and I got food poisoning from this ""upscale"" restaurant. We had diarrhea, vomiting, body aches, fever for days and some of the bacteria stayed in our system for months, our digestion never quite the same again. The DOH took our stool samples but we never heard back from them- the case probably closed- I wonder why and how...The manager at first tried to suggest other ways we all got ill but we wouldn't have it. In the end, he offered a free meal which was a nice extension from them towards us but we never took it. The funny thing is that I have eaten from many carts and smaller ""dirty"" restaurants which are constantly on watch from DOH but have never been food poisoned there but yet ABC-K such a famous joint by a famous chef made us sick. Looks like no one else on yelp had any issues which is great. Wonder what the hell went wrong with our servers/cooks/busboys..????Oh, onto the food. (This is a review of the food without bias from the food poisoning). It was pretty good but more about the ambiance. There are minor interesting things but nothing warranting 4 or 5 stars. This is just another over-hyped place where marketing wins and people who want to see and be seen go- the blind following the blind. From the dishes we had- chicken liver toast, fig pizza and some other things- I can't imagine higher than 3 stars. Service was okay, nothing too memorable. I'd prefer Red Cat, Good Fork, Salt & Fat or TRAIF which have a greater attention to the intricacies of flavors, textures and presentation."
Tom L.,"Hudson, NY",12/2/2018,3 star rating,"Got the scrambled eggs and potatoes for brunch.  They may have scrambled one egg?  Really small portion.  And the waiter warned us they cook the eggs ""runny"" and did we want them tighter.  I did, and they did not come out that way.  Not fully cooked tiny portion of scrambled eggs.  And I think it cost like $13... maybe more?  I felt gipped."
Dana T.,"New York, NY",4/11/2017,5 star rating,"First visit to ABC Kitchen last night with husband and 23-year old daughter to celebrate her new job.  This place is so special - where to begin?  I'm super-picky about lighting, so I was bowled over by the overall beauty and ambiance of this lovely space.  It's buzzing with activity without being overbearingly noisy.  Service was superb - relaxed and friendly, and the food was delicious (fois gras pate toast, crab toast, mushroom/onion/parmesan pizza, the signature burger, a salted caramel sundae ... Everything was delicious and well-portioned.  ABC Kitchen is on the expensive side, but it's worth it.  So happy to finally try this long-beloved restaurant."
Caroline P.,"Dallas, TX",2/2/2016,5 star rating,"This restaurant is amazing!! Maybe my favorite restaurant in NYC. From the crab toast to the lobster to the Carmel sundae, I can't describe in words how delicious it all is! Their cocktails are amazing as well. Highly recommend the ginger margarita!!"
Derek A.,"Fairview, NJ",10/5/2015,4 star rating,"I have dined a few times at ABC and I have never been disappointed. The brunch menu is my favorite or maybe I just love a good brunch meal bit it's always been top notch. I love the recycled look that they use with silverware and napkins. The food is if course the best part of the meal, simply cooked and seasoned vegetables that bring out the natural flavors of the vegetable at its peak if season. Drink and wine program is par for the course for a restaurant such as this, but not disappointing.Overall good experiences while dining at this restaurant and any of JG's restaurants."
Tiff Y.,"Bayside, Queens, NY",10/29/2014,5 star rating,"Thanks to my good friend Jenn, this is my new favorite spot of all time! This is a great date night/girls night place to have a beautiful dinner!The decor and atmosphere is so beautiful and I love the rustic feel and the look. I loved it so much that when I was looking around I saw a celebrity 2 tables away from me! (Star struck)The food blew me away. From the way they plate the food, the different tastes, everything was delicious. There isn't one thing I didn't like. We ordered a few different appetizers and a few different entrees.  The 2 desserts we ordered were the donuts and the almond pear tart.Our waitress was so sweet and I swear my water glass was filled NONSTOP. That was my 1 pet peeve at a restaurant is that my water should be automatically refilled and this happened here! Even on a busy Friday night with line of people at the door, we were not rushed to finish quickly and we really took our time.This is a restaurant to rave about! Amazing service, great atmosphere,  great food, this restaurant has it all!"
Ilona K.,"Wilton, CT",2/18/2015,3 star rating,"The food was really good but the service was subpar. They really try to get you out of there very quickly. If you plan to come in and enjoy yourself, go elsewhere. The food leaves the kitchen quickly but they rush you just as much."
Lawrence P.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",6/6/2014,5 star rating,"I/we LOVE this place. We have gone twice and I think every time we go to NY, we'll stop bye.  It is just amazing.  The restaurant is just beautiful.  Extremely well decorated in a rustic yet elegant modern style, this place is one of my favorite spots in NYC.  What makes ABC Kitchen's ambiance is the fact that despite how busy it is, the servers and help staff are perfectly synchronized... it's like organized chaos and I love it!!!  As for the food, where to start... OK, we'll go with the suckling pig.  My Cuban wifey described it as ""holy goodness."" We all made fun of her ordering pork at a French restaurant but once it arrived, it was phenomenal. PERIOD, end of story.  On our second visit, we made fun of her for ordering fried chicken at a French restaurant.  Next time I am just going to order whatever she's having because that was the best fried chicken ever!!!!  This place is, simply stated, money!!! No matter what we order, it has always been amazing. As for me, in one of our visits I ordered the scallops.  When they came, I thought they brought me the wrong order as they were cut in sushi like thin pieces.  You guessed it... AMAZING!!!   Their wine list, as are most, is a bit overpriced.  We ordered a Chateu du Pape for $175 which I later found out retails for $70. Used to it and will return time and time again whenever I am in NY."
Krysten S.,"New York, NY",3/8/2018,5 star rating,"Only have great things to say about this place. Love the vibes... from the the decor to the food/drinks, and especially the service, this place is amazing. Their homemade pastas are delicious, can't wait to go back!"
Patrick O.,"Manhattan, NY",9/30/2017,5 star rating,Delicious. I have been here twice and each time was delicious. The service is excellent and the rustic vibe is cute.
Paola O.,"Washington, DC",9/27/2015,4 star rating,"The service was very good. The food was good, but I have had better. I ordered the bowtie pasta with veal meatballs. It was really good. If you love mushrooms, I recommend the mushroom pizza. The mashed potatoes were excellent."
Shayna F.,"Sammamish, WA",11/24/2014,4 star rating,"Consistently delicious and keeps me coming back for more.Their pizzas, pastas, salads, and ice creams all taste like magic.Perhaps I've just gotten lucky, but oddly enough I've never had trouble with getting a table with the maximum wait being 35 minutes...not bad for great atmosphere, great food, and incredible service."
Sandie L.,"San Francisco, CA",7/14/2014,5 star rating,"Um, have I mentioned that brunch is my favorite meal of the day?  My bf's friend couldn't make it to their reservation so they asked if we wanted it.  Since we both had no brunch plans... SURE! (heard that they made reservations way ahead of time, so  highly recommended to make reservations)Absolutely love the decor and vibe here.  It felt like SF here with the organic, rustic, picked veggies from the back yard feel.  We ordered the crab toast (MUST TRY!) and the benedict.  Both was delicious.  Needless to say, I will be back!"
Neha M.,"Seattle, WA",4/4/2014,4 star rating,"Yummmoza! ABC kitchen entrance is in this quaint street and almost too easy to go unnoticed. Once inside, the environment and decor is beautiful! After all this is a part of the ABC furniture & decor store. On to the food - as a girl I can only eat so much. Everything is huge heavy huge. I had the famous butternut squash/ ricotta toast. It was yummy - the sweet and savory mixed perfectly well on an over-ly buttered toast. Wish it was not as heavy because this prevented me from trying their other food. I also got the lime-rosemary homemade soda. I love places that offer such drinks - especially at lunch when I don't want to drink alcohol and too bored of standard non-alc drinks.I did a cookie platter dessert to go - it had 5 different types of cookies. All for $10! Starting with the classic choc chip to fancy ones like white chocolate/ blood orange etc. Overall food is yumm, feel of the place is mod and stylish, prices are great and now if the portion sizes were trimmed down or made lighter, I would love it even more."
Britnee S.,"Seaside, CA",6/10/2017,5 star rating,"What a fabulous night out, it isn't always I decide to go have an expensive romantic night out with my girls but in lasts nights occasion of visiting my best friend for the first time in three years I think we made the perfect choice! Luckily for us we love to share, the chefs did an outstanding job splitting everything up before they even came out. Just to make things slightly complicated we asked the bar tender to get creative with a whiskey drinks, a perfectly done whiskey sour infused with a hint of orange and bitters swept us off our feet. The menu was quite detailed and provided a variety of options. We shared two appetizer/starters. The tuna ginger deluxe sashimi was absolutely mouth watering greatness. A taste I will never forget! Followed by the carrot avocado salad (a suggestion by the waiter) it was also very delightful! By this point we were already enthusiasts but we still had a few courses left. We ordered the buttery fried chicken with greens and it was probably the best chicken dish I have ever ordered. It was buttery, Spicy and cooked to perfection. Our dessert followed in perfect timing, this is the part I am always most excited about! The strawberry rhubarb pie was yummy but with the only let down of the night hardly had any ""filling"" with rhubarb and strawberry to it. It was mostly crust. Beyond that the interior and environment is quite lovely and the wait staff were prompt, adorable, helpful and very nice! We enjoyed every minute of our experience. Great for special occasions, fancy date nights, and suggestions for visiting friends who are willing to drop a few dollars on a nice meal!"
Shay K.,"New York, NY",9/21/2015,4 star rating,Waiter informative. Deco romantic unique. Food was good. Expecting something extraordinary based on the hype. My partner felt the food wasn't hot enough.
Herve B.,"New York, NY",11/16/2017,1 star rating,"This probably the worst service one can hope for - 30 min after reservation time, still not seated, although I can see a table is ready, and has been for 20+ minutes... they don't care and you should avoid"
Shelton H.,"Park Ridge, NJ",6/7/2017,4 star rating,"I walked in with some colleagues on a weeknight and of course we couldn't get seats without a reservation without about an hour wait. No problem, totally understand, it's a popular place. We were lucky enough to sit at the bar and ordered a bunch of apps for dinner and some of the flatbread pizzas. It was all great and the wine list was really good quality/value."
Sam O.,"Paris, France",2/27/2015,2 star rating,I use to love this place with pretty people watching and pretty food. My regular dishes were not the same (the pizza with goat cheese and spinach) is not anymore that scrumptious piece of heaven and it took them 30 minutes to get it! And wrong. The tuna sashimi is ok.Staff is good but clueless when it comes to deal with your food delay l.Went out without even ordering any desserts (i was THAT disappointment)No coming back Jean George .
Sherry W.,"Framingham, MA",11/16/2015,5 star rating,"A friend highly recommended this restaurant to me and we have to book our table half month ahead of time. But the inside of this place is lovely, perfect for special occasions. The salmon I ordered is delicious."
Huong N.,"San Jose, CA",6/9/2014,5 star rating,"WOW! This is pretty amazing on the decor and the staff are all so coordinated! My friends and I made a reservation here for lunch and the time we got was 3pm. Didn't realize how busy this place gets at 3pm but it was worth the hungry stomach. When we entered the restaurant, Peter Dinklage was sitting there at the bar:)I never thought I would able to see such a gorgeous restaurant. It would be cool, if my house look like that. What we ordered:raw diver scallops, sea beans, green chilies and spring herbsfrench friesblack sea bass with chilies and herbs, spinach and basil The raw scallops was super fresh that I can probably eat another plate of it. My friends had spilt the sea bass and raved how good it taste. This is one place, I would always return for meals, If i ever come back and visit NYC."
Katie W.,"Chicago, IL",3/11/2019,3 star rating,"I've been wanting to try this place for quite some time and it was mostly great but a couple things made it feel like a rip off. Almost immediately after we ordered, two of our dishes came out and then a couple minutes later the third one arrived, so half of our items came out in the span of like 10 minutes. At first we were impressed but that quickly turned to annoyance that they were just trying to turn the table as fast as possible. There's really no need to be deluged with food from the get go, especially at these prices. Which brings me to my second point...it is expensive *for what it is*. The ambiance is amazing and the food is very good, but it is not unique. Many, many restaurants serve exactly this genre of food and do it just as well but at a more reasonable price. The kale salad is $18 and we literally laughed at the portion size. It was a light dusting of kale (we could see the plate through the salad) and it had maybe 4-5 small croutons and a couple peppers. It was good but should have been $10. Same with pretty much everything we tried - delicious but overpriced. This struck me as the type of place that's ideal for a group because it has a great vibe and there's something for everyone, but I didn't leave feeling like I had to come back."
Stace C.,"New York, NY",3/18/2013,5 star rating,"I've been here for dinner but this past weekend I came to check out their brunch (posted pictures).  To start we ordered from the market table their squash toast with apple cider & ricotta cheese.  My favorite dish, the flavor was perfect.  I'm a huge fan of foie gras so I decided to try the chicken liver, it was too overwhelming in taste.  The eggs benedict is always a solid bet and they did a good job, cooked perfectly.  For the table to share we tried the french toast, reminded me of Jane's with some stuffing inside.  I love having sweet & savory.  The salmon & potato cakes looked appealing but didn't stand out.  Service was on point, didn't expect anything less from a visit to one of JG's establishments.  Loved the large open space with white tables & had a very homey feel.  We were seated near the kitchen/ farm veggies area, adorable! Tips: Make reservations in advance.  Chamomile rose tea is good for hangovers at brunch!"
